# Reading10 Aggregate Output, Prices, and Economic Growth

## 1. GDP, Income, Expenditure

- GDP Explanation with Income or Expenditure Approach
  - Gross Domestic Product(GDP):
    - a measurement of the `size` of nation's economy
    - Definition: total market value of the final goods and services produced in a country during a certain time period.
      - only **newly produced** taken into account,while for products produced *previous year* resold/sold is *excluded*.(Timing!)
      - <u>Governments Transfer payments</u> are not included.
        - eg: unemployment, retirement, welfare benefits 
      - The <u>intermediate goods</u> are not included.
  - Components:
    - Goods and services provided by **governments** are included in GDP, even through they are <u>not priced</u> in markets.
      - eg: roads and infrastructure improvements, service provided by police...are valued at costs to government
    - the value of **owner-occupied housing**(renting house service) is included in GDP calculation, even though it's not revealed in market transactions.
    - <u>value of labor</u> and <u>by-products</u> of production are not included in GDP
  - Calculation methods:`total expenditure=total income`
    1. expenditure approach
       - sum the amounts <u>spent</u> on goods and services produced during the period
    2. income approach
       - amounts <u>earned</u> by households and companies during the period
         - Content: include wage income(household), interest income(government), business profits(firms)
- Value-of-final-output method VS Sum-of-value-added method(Equal at final)
  - Value-of-final-output method: 
    - under expenditure approach
    - Definition: sum the values of all *final* goods and service produced
  - Sum-of-value-added method:
    - Definition: sum the <u>additions to value</u> created *at each stage* of production and distribution
- Nominal GDP, Real GDP, and GDP deflator
  - Nominal GDP: 
    - valued at current market price
    - Formula: $GDP_{nominal,t}=\sum_{i=1}^N P_{i,t}Q_{i,t}$
      - $N$: numbers of different goods and services
      - $i$: goods and service index; $t$: time index
  - Real GDP:
    - using price from <u>base year</u>, <u>removing</u> effects of inflation which <u>caused by economic growth</u>
    - represent the only increases **in total output**, not increases in <u>money value</u> of total output
    - Formula:$GDP_{Real,t,m}=\sum_{i=1}^N P_{i,t-m}Q_{i,t}$
      - $i$: goods and service index; $t$: time index
      - $m$: how many years ago from now, to get the target base year
  - GDP Deflator:
    - a *price index* to convert nominal_GDP ro real_GDP
    - Formula: $GDP \space Deflator=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N P_{i,t}Q_{i,t}}{\sum_{i=1}^N P_{i,t-m}Q_{i,t}} *100= Nominal GDP/Real GDP*100$
  - Per-capita real GDP:
    - measures of *economic well-being* of countries' residents
    - formula: $Real_GDP/Population$
- GDP, National Income, Personal Income, Personal Disposal Income
  - Real GDP components `expenditure` approach: consumption, investment, government spending, net exports(export-import)
    - Formula: $GDP=C+I+G+(X-M)$ OR $GDP=(C+G^C)+(I+G^I)+(X-M)$
      - $G^C$: government consumption
      - $G^I$: government investment(capital goods, inventories)
      - $G$: government purchase
  - Real GDP components `Income` approach: or called **GDI(gross domestic income)**
    - Formula: $GDP=national \space income+ capital \space consumption \space allowance+statistical \space discrepancy$
      - *CCA*: depreciation of physical capital, the amount have to be reinvested to maintain the productivity of physical capital
      - *Statistical discrepancy*: <u>adjustment</u> for GDP under **income and expenditure** approach
      - National Income: all factors of production which distribute to final output
        - `NI=compensation of employees(wages, benefits) + corporate and government enterprise profits before tax + interest income + rent + business owners' income + indirect business taxes- subsidies`
      - Personal income: 
        - <u>pretax</u> income received by household, one determinate of <u>consumer purchasing power</u> and consumption
        - includes all income that household receives, including government transfer payments
      - Household/personal disposable income: 
        - personal income after tax
        - indicator of the ability of consumers to <u>spend and save</u>
        - the amount of money households have ability to save or spend
- Saving, Investment, Fiscal Balance, and Trade Balance
  - The relationship
    - in terms of total income, $GDP=C+S+T$, $S$: household and business savings, $T$: net taxes, $C$: consumption spending
    - Total income=total expenditure: $C+I+G+(X-M)=C+S+T$ -> Rewrite the formula: $S=I+(G-T)+(X-M)$
      - $(G-T)$: fiscal balance, government spending-tax receipts
        - $(G-T)< 0$: budget surplus
        - $(G-T)>0$: budget deficit
      - $(X-M)$: net export, trade balance. The sign of it means trade surplus and negative surplus
    - Rewrite the formula: $(G-T)=(S-I)-(X-M)$

## 2. Aggregate Demand and Supply

- Aggregate Demand(AD) Curve
  - negative relationship between price and output level demanded by customers, firms, or government
  - Conditions(Assumptions):
    1. Goods market equilibrium: aggregate income=aggregate expenditure
    2. money market equilibrium: individuals and firms are willing to hold real money supply
  - Three effects to explain downward sloping:
    1. Wealth effect:
       - how price level changes affect consumers' purchasing power(negative relationship)
       - people feel richer with lower price, consumptions increase
    2. Interest rate effect
       - related to <u>demand for money</u>
       - if price level↑, people's need for holding nominal money balances↑
       - interest is the opportunity cost of holding money
       - higher interest rate, **less** demand for <u>consumption goods</u> and less <u>business investment</u> demand, with the money supply fixed.
         - especially goods purchased in credit.
         - higher cost of capital, # of profitable investment projects↓
    3. Real exchange rate effect汇率
       - effect domestic price level↑ on net export $(X-M)$
         - domestic price level↑ relative to foreign country
           - real price level of domestic product↑ for foreigners, demand for exports↓
           - real price of imported goods to domestic consumers and business↓, quantity of imports demand from domestic consumers↑.
           - As consequences, net exports ↓, aggregate demand ↓. 
- Short/long Run Aggregate Supply Curve
  - The Aggregate Supply(AS) Curve
    - Definition: relationship between the price level and quantity of real GDP supplied.
    - Classification with different time frames: 
      - VSRAS(very short run aggregate supply): 
        - characteristic: horizontal line, perfectly elastic
        - reason: firm will change price level irrelevant to labor working hours or use of materials or equipment
      - SRAS: 
        - characteristic: upward sloping
        - reason: <u>output prices</u> will change proportionally to the <u>price level</u>, but <u>input prices level</u> no changes in the short run.成本短期内不变,也可以说是没来得及跟着调整，生产的产品价格上涨
          - Hence, firm will increase output to gain more profit from higher output prices.
      - LRAS: 
        - characteristic: perfectly inelastic, vertical line
        - reason: all input costs can vary.input prices change proportionally to the price level 成本随产品价格变动, pricing level has no effect on aggregate supply.
          - **Potential output/Full-employment GDP**: the output quantity at this level.
  - Shift in Aggregate Demand and Supply Curves 
    - Shift in Aggregate Demand Curve
      - AD curve: total expenditure level by consumers, business, governments, foreigners $GDP=C+I+G+(X-M)$
      - Increase in AD: 
        - Graph interpretation: the curve will shift to right，slope unchanged
          - Intuition: given any price level, quantity of goods and services demanded ↑
        - Factors:
          - Consumer's wealth increase: proportion of saving↓, spending↑, AD ↑, $C$ ↑
          - Business expectations: if it is optimistic乐观, investment in 生产资料↑, $I$ ↑
          - Consumer expectations of future income: eg: greater job stability, rising wage income, they savings↓, spending ↑, AD ↑, $C$ ↑
          - High capacity utilization: firms produce at a high percentage of their capacity, investment in 生产资料↑, AD ↑, $I$ ↑
          - Expansionary monetary policy扩张性财政政策: rate of growth of the money supply ↑, banks funds lending ↑(availability of credit ↑), interest rate↓, cost of financing ↓, investment in plant and equipment ↑, customers' spend on durables by credit ↑, AD↑, $C$ & $I$ ↑
          - Expansionary fiscal policy扩张性财政政策: **taxes**↓ or **government expenditure**↑--> government budget surplus↓, budget deficit ↑, disposable income and consumption ↑, AD ↑, $C$ & $G$ ↑
          - Exchange rate: country currency relative value ↓, exports↑, imports↓, AD↑, $(X-M)$↑
          - Global economic growth: GDP of foreign economies ↑, quantity of export本国的↑, AD ↑, $(X-M)$↑
    - Shift in Aggregate Short Run Supply Curve
      - Factors of ASRS shifting to right increase:
        - labor productivity: with fixed wage rate, labor output/hr ↑, unit costs to producer ↓, output ↑
        - Input prices:↓ --> production costs ↓, production ↑, SRAS ↑
          - **Wages** are most parts of production costs which have greatest impact on SRAS.
        - Expectations of future output prices: if the firm expects the price of products ↑, production ↑, SRAS ↑
        - Taxes and government subsidies: business taxes ↓, government subsidies ↑, cost of production ↓,output ↑, SRAS ↑.
        - Exchange rates: country currency relative value↑, cost of import ↓, production cost ↓, output ↑, SRAS ↑
    - Shift in Aggregate Long Run Supply Curve
      - Factors of shifting to right(LARS increase):
        - supply and quality of labor increase: full-employment output ↑, train&education-->skills of workforce↑, productivity with a given size ↑单位产量增加, LRAS↑
        - supply of natural resources ↑, LRAS↑
        - stock of physical capital: accumulated stock of capital equipment ↑, potential output↑, LRAS↑
        - technology improvement: labor productivity↑, real output↑, LRAS↑
    - <u>Price level changes</u> **cannot** alone cause shifts AD and AS curves. However, the expected future prices changes can shift.

## 3. Macroeconomic Equilibrium and Growth

- Effects of Fluctuation in AD and AS Changes on Real GDP and Business Cycle
  - Long-run full employment equilibrium
    - Graph interpretation:
      - X-axis: Output, real GDP; Y-axis: Price level, index
      - AD curve, downward sloping
      - LRAS, vertical line, perfectly elastic
      - SRAS, upward sloping, intercept AD with $(GDP^*,P_0)$
    - Adjustment to a decrease in AD
      - Situation: 
        - AD moves left to $AD_1$, the equilibrium price decreases. 
        - In short run, the new equilibrium reach at $(GDP_1,P_{SR})$, where $GDP_1< GDP^*$, $P_{SR}<P_0$
      - **Recession gap**: Real GDP< full employment GDP
        - a period of declining GDP and unemployment rising
      - Solutions:
        - **Classical**: 市场具有自我调节能力 unemployment will cut down wages, $SRAS$ ↑ shift to right, back to full employment level of real GDP.
        - **Keynesian**: government active 
          - expansionary fiscal/monetary policy, $AD$ ↑, return to full employment level of real GDP.
    - Adjustment to an increase in AD
      - **Inflationary gap**: real GDP> full employment GDP
        - upward pressure on pricing level
        - Reasons: workers work overtime, maintenance of productive equipment is delayed
        - the gap *cannot exist in long-run*, the economy will back to full-employment state.
        - competition makes SARS shift left->economy to full-employment GDP level, new equilibrium price $P_{LR}$>$P_0$
        - Solution: 
          - <u>government policies</u> **reduce AD** back to initial long-run equilibrium at full-employment GDP
   - Adjustment to a decrease in SRAS: 
      - **Stagflation**滞涨(stagnant economy with inflation)
        - Situation: Increase productive input price(eg: wage rate, price of raw material) , SARS shift decreasing, reach to a new equilibrium as the interception of $AD_0$ and $SARS_1$ at $(GDP_2, P_SR)$, where $GDP_2< GDP^*$, and $P_0<P_SR<P_LR$
        - Characteristic: declining GDP output and higher prices
        - Solution:
          - input prices decrease
          - expansionary fiscal or monetary policy
    - Adjustment to an increase in SRAS:
      - Situation: input price ↓, reach at a new equilibrium $(GDP_1,P_1)$ the interception between $SRAS_1$ and $AD$, with $GDP_1>GDP^*$ and $P_1< P_0$, unemployment decrease
- Effects of Combined Changes in AS and AD on Economy
  - When AS & AD move in the <u>same direction</u>, the situation is *clear* enough. On the other hand,if they move in an <u>opposite direction</u>, it is *ambiguous*.
  - 4 Situations
    - AD & AS ↑: real GDP ↑, pricing level not sure
    - AD & AS ↓: Real GDP ↓, pricing level not sure
    - AD ↑, AS ↓:pricing level↑, Real GDP not sure
    - AD ↓, AS ↑: pricing level ↓, Real GDP not sure
- Source, Measurement, Sustainability of Economic Growth
  - Sources
    - labor supply
      - Definition of labor force: # of people age>16, either working or available for work but currently unemployed
      - factors
        - population growth
        - net immigration
        - labor force participation rate
    - human capital
      - education and skill level of labor
      - high quality HC, more productive and better to take advantage of advancing in technology
    - physical capital stock
      - high rate of investment, stock of physical capital ↑-->labor productivity and potential GDP ↑ 
    - technology
    - natural resources
      - renewable and non-renewable resources
  - Sustainability
    - Measurement
      - potential GDP=aggregate hours worked * labor productivity
      - growth in potential GDP=growth in labor force + growth in labor productivity
    - sustainable rate of economic growth is important for long-term equity return. Namely, it is the rate of potential GDP.
- Production Function and Economic Growth Source
  - Production Function
    - Definition: relationship between output and input(size of labor force, capital stock, productivity)
    - Function: $Y=A*f(L,K)$
      - $A$: 
        - total factor productivity, 
        - closely related to <u>technology development</u>. 
        - It cannot be observed directly, but can be indirectly inferred.
        - quantifies the amount of output growth <u>not explained</u> by labor and capital. 
      - $K$: amount of capital available
      - $L$: size of labor force
  - Labor Productivity function(变体)
      - Function: $Y/L=A* f(K/L)$
      - intuition: the labor productivity can be increased by either improving technology and physical capital per worker.
  - Traits: 
    - Diminishing marginal productivity: amount of additional output produced by each additional unit of input decrease.
      - 所以，长期可持续经济增长不能仅仅通过physical capital deepening investment来促进, productivity gains and labor force growth 同样很重要
- Input Growth Effect on GDP VS Growth Total Factor Productivity as Economics Components
  - Formula: `growth in potential GDP=growth(Technology,Labor,Capital)`
    - $W_L$: labor percentage share of national income
    - $W_C$: capital percentage share of national income
    - $A$: change in **total factor productivity**, not related with L or C, which is the primary driven by <u>technology development</u>
  - Rewrite formula in per-capita basis: `growth in per-capita GDP= growth in technology+Wc(growth in capital-to-labor ratio)`
    - in developed countries, capita per worker is *already relatively high*, <u>growth in technology</u> is the <u>primary</u> source of GDP growth.
