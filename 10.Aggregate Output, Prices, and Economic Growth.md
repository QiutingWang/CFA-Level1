# Reading10 Aggregate Output, Prices, and Economic Growth

## 1. GDP, Income, Expenditure

- GDP Explanation with Income or Expenditure Approach
  - Gross Domestic Product(GDP):
    - a measurement of the `size` of nation's economy
    - Definition: total market value of the final goods and services produced in a country during a certain time period.
      - only **newly produced** taken into account,while for products produced *previous year* resold/sold is *excluded*.(Timing!)
      - <u>Governments Transfer payments</u> are not included.
        - eg: unemployment, retirement, welfare benefits 
      - The <u>intermediate goods</u> are not included.
  - Components:
    - Goods and services provided by **governments** are included in GDP, even through they are <u>not priced</u> in markets.
      - eg: roads and infrastructure improvements, service provided by police...are valued at costs to government
    - the value of **owner-occupied housing**(renting house service) is included in GDP calculation, even though it's not revealed in market transactions.
    - <u>value of labor</u> and <u>by-products</u> of production are not included in GDP
  - Calculation methods:`total expenditure=total income`
    1. expenditure approach
       - sum the amounts <u>spent</u> on goods and services produced during the period
    2. income approach
       - amounts <u>earned</u> by households and companies during the period
         - Content: include wage income(household), interest income(government), business profits(firms)
- Value-of-final-output method VS Sum-of-value-added method(Equal at final)
  - Value-of-final-output method: 
    - under expenditure approach
    - Definition: sum the values of all *final* goods and service produced
  - Sum-of-value-added method:
    - Definition: sum the <u>additions to value</u> created *at each stage* of production and distribution
- Nominal GDP, Real GDP, and GDP deflator
  - Nominal GDP: 
    - valued at current market price
    - Formula: $GDP_{nominal,t}=\sum_{i=1}^N P_{i,t}Q_{i,t}$
      - $N$: numbers of different goods and services
      - $i$: goods and service index; $t$: time index
  - Real GDP:
    - using price from <u>base year</u>, <u>removing</u> effects of inflation which <u>caused by economic growth</u>
    - represent the only increases **in total output**, not increases in <u>money value</u> of total output
    - Formula:$GDP_{Real,t,m}=\sum_{i=1}^N P_{i,t-m}Q_{i,t}$
      - $i$: goods and service index; $t$: time index
      - $m$: how many years ago from now, to get the target base year
  - GDP Deflator:
    - a *price index* to convert nominal_GDP ro real_GDP
    - Formula: $GDP \space Deflator=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N P_{i,t}Q_{i,t}}{\sum_{i=1}^N P_{i,t-m}Q_{i,t}} *100= Nominal GDP/Real GDP*100$
  - Per-capita real GDP:
    - measures of *economic well-being* of countries' residents
    - formula: $Real_GDP/Population$
- GDP, National Income, Personal Income, Personal Disposal Income
  - Real GDP components `expenditure` approach: consumption, investment, government spending, net exports(export-import)
    - Formula: $GDP=C+I+G+(X-M)$ OR $GDP=(C+G^C)+(I+G^I)+(X-M)$
      - $G^C$: government consumption
      - $G^I$: government investment(capital goods, inventories)
      - $G$: government purchase
  - Real GDP components `Income` approach: or called **GDI(gross domestic income)**
    - Formula: $GDP=national \space income+ capital \space consumption \space allowance+statistical \space discrepancy$
      - *CCA*: depreciation of physical capital, the amount have to be reinvested to maintain the productivity of physical capital
      - *Statistical discrepancy*: <u>adjustment</u> for GDP under **income and expenditure** approach
      - National Income: all factors of production which distribute to final output
        - `NI=compensation of employees(wages, benefits) + corporate and government enterprise profits before tax + interest income + rent + business owners' income + indirect business taxes- subsidies`
      - Personal income: 
        - <u>pretax</u> income received by household, one determinate of <u>consumer purchasing power</u> and consumption
        - includes all income that household receives, including government transfer payments
      - Household/personal disposable income: 
        - personal income after tax
        - indicator of the ability of consumers to <u>spend and save</u>
        - the amount of money households have ability to save or spend
- Saving, Investment, Fiscal Balance, and Trade Balance
  - The relationship
    - in terms of total income, $GDP=C+S+T$, $S$: household and business savings, $T$: net taxes, $C$: consumption spending
    - Total income=total expenditure: $C+I+G+(X-M)=C+S+T$ -> Rewrite the formula: $S=I+(G-T)+(X-M)$
      - $(G-T)$: fiscal balance, government spending-tax receipts
        - $(G-T)< 0$: budget surplus
        - $(G-T)>0$: budget deficit
      - $(X-M)$: net export, trade balance. The sign of it means trade surplus and negative surplus
    - Rewrite the formula: $(G-T)=(S-I)-(X-M)$

## 2. Aggregate Demand and Supply

- Aggregate Demand(AD) Curve
  - negative relationship between price and output level demanded by customers, firms, or government
  - Conditions(Assumptions):
    1. Goods market equilibrium: aggregate income=aggregate expenditure
    2. money market equilibrium: individuals and firms are willing to hold real money supply
  - Three effects to explain downward sloping:
    1. Wealth effect:
       - how price level changes affect consumers' purchasing power(negative relationship)
       - people feel richer with lower price, consumptions increase
    2. Interest rate effect
       - related to <u>demand for money</u>
       - if price level↑, people's need for holding nominal money balances↑
       - interest is the opportunity cost of holding money
       - higher interest rate, **less** demand for <u>consumption goods</u> and less <u>business investment</u> demand, with the money supply fixed.
         - especially goods purchased in credit.
         - higher cost of capital, # of profitable investment projects↓
    3. Real exchange rate effect汇率
       - effect domestic price level↑ on net export $(X-M)$
         - domestic price level↑ relative to foreign country
           - real price level of domestic product↑ for foreigners, demand for exports↓
           - real price of imported goods to domestic consumers and business↓, quantity of imports demand from domestic consumers↑.
           - As consequences, net exports ↓, aggregate demand ↓. 
- Short/long Run Aggregate Supply Curve
  - The Aggregate Supply(AS) Curve
    - Definition: relationship between the price level and quantity of real GDP supplied.
    - Classification with different time frames: 
      - VSRAS(very short run aggregate supply): 
        - characteristic: horizontal line, perfectly elastic
        - reason: firm will change price level irrelevant to labor working hours or use of materials or equipment
      - SRAS: 
        - characteristic: upward sloping
        - reason: <u>output prices</u> will change proportionally to the <u>price level</u>, but <u>input prices level</u> no changes in the short run.成本短期内不变,也可以说是没来得及跟着调整，生产的产品价格上涨
          - Hence, firm will increase output to gain more profit from higher output prices.
      - LRAS: 
        - characteristic: perfectly inelastic, vertical line
        - reason: all input costs can vary.input prices change proportionally to the price level 成本随产品价格变动, pricing level has no effect on aggregate supply.
          - **Potential output/Full-employment GDP**: the output quantity at this level.
  - Shift in Aggregate Demand and Supply Curves 
    - Shift in Aggregate Demand Curve
      - AD curve: total expenditure level by consumers, business, governments, foreigners $GDP=C+I+G+(X-M)$
      - Increase in AD: 
        - Graph interpretation: the curve will shift to right，slope unchanged
          - Intuition: given any price level, quantity of goods and services demanded ↑
        - Factors:
          - Consumer's wealth increase: proportion of saving↓, spending↑, AD ↑, $C$ ↑
          - Business expectations: if it is optimistic乐观, investment in 生产资料↑, $I$ ↑
          - Consumer expectations of future income: eg: greater job stability, rising wage income, they savings↓, spending ↑, AD ↑, $C$ ↑
          - High capacity utilization: firms produce at a high percentage of their capacity, investment in 生产资料↑, AD ↑, $I$ ↑
          - Expansionary monetary policy扩张性财政政策: rate of growth of the money supply ↑, banks funds lending ↑(availability of credit ↑), interest rate↓, cost of financing ↓, investment in plant and equipment ↑, customers' spend on durables by credit ↑, AD↑, $C$ & $I$ ↑
          - Expansionary fiscal policy扩张性财政政策: **taxes**↓ or **government expenditure**↑--> government budget surplus↓, budget deficit ↑, disposable income and consumption ↑, AD ↑, $C$ & $G$ ↑
          - Exchange rate: country currency relative value ↓, exports↑, imports↓, AD↑, $(X-M)$↑
          - Global economic growth: GDP of foreign economies ↑, quantity of export本国的↑, AD ↑, $(X-M)$↑
    - Shift in Aggregate Short Run Supply Curve
      - Factors of ASRS shifting to right increase:
        - labor productivity: with fixed wage rate, labor output/hr ↑, unit costs to producer ↓, output ↑
        - Input prices:↓ --> production costs ↓, production ↑, SRAS ↑
          - **Wages** are most parts of production costs which have greatest impact on SRAS.
        - Expectations of future output prices: if the firm expects the price of products ↑, production ↑, SRAS ↑
        - Taxes and government subsidies: business taxes ↓, government subsidies ↑, cost of production ↓,output ↑, SRAS ↑.
        - Exchange rates: country currency relative value↑, cost of import ↓, production cost ↓, output ↑, SRAS ↑
    - Shift in Aggregate Long Run Supply Curve
      - Factors of shifting to right(LARS increase):
        - supply and quality of labor increase: full-employment output ↑, train&education-->skills of workforce↑, productivity with a given size ↑单位产量增加, LRAS↑
        - supply of natural resources ↑, LRAS↑
        - stock of physical capital: accumulated stock of capital equipment ↑, potential output↑, LRAS↑
        - technology improvement: labor productivity↑, real output↑, LRAS↑
    - <u>Price level changes</u> **cannot** alone cause shifts AD and AS curves. However, the expected future prices changes can shift.
