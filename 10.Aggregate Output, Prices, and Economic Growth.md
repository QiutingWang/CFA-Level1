# Reading10 Aggregate Output, Prices, and Economic Growth

## 1. GDP, Income, Expenditure

- GDP Explanation with Income or Expenditure Approach
  - Gross Domestic Product(GDP):
    - a measurement of the `size` of nation's economy
    - Definition: total market value of the final goods and services produced in a country during a certain time period.
      - only **newly produced** taken into account,while for products produced *previous year* resold/sold is *excluded*.(Timing!)
      - <u>Governments Transfer payments</u> are not included.
        - eg: unemployment, retirement, welfare benefits 
      - The <u>intermediate goods</u> are not included.
  - Components:
    - Goods and services provided by **governments** are included in GDP, even through they are <u>not priced</u> in markets.
      - eg: roads and infrastructure improvements, service provided by police...are valued at costs to government
    - the value of **owner-occupied housing**(renting house service) is included in GDP calculation, even though it's not revealed in market transactions.
    - <u>value of labor</u> and <u>by-products</u> of production are not included in GDP
  - Calculation methods:`total expenditure=total income`
    1. expenditure approach
       - sum the amounts <u>spent</u> on goods and services produced during the period
    2. income approach
       - amounts <u>earned</u> by households and companies during the period
         - Content: include wage income(household), interest income(government), business profits(firms)
- Value-of-final-output method VS Sum-of-value-added method(Equal at final)
  - Value-of-final-output method: 
    - under expenditure approach
    - Definition: sum the values of all *final* goods and service produced
  - Sum-of-value-added method:
    - Definition: sum the <u>additions to value</u> created *at each stage* of production and distribution
- Nominal GDP, Real GDP, and GDP deflator
  - Nominal GDP: 
    - valued at current market price
    - Formula: $GDP_{nominal,t}=\sum_{i=1}^N P_{i,t}Q_{i,t}$
      - $N$: numbers of different goods and services
      - $i$: goods and service index; $t$: time index
  - Real GDP:
    - using price from <u>base year</u>, <u>removing</u> effects of inflation which <u>caused by economic growth</u>
    - represent the only increases **in total output**, not increases in <u>money value</u> of total output
    - Formula:$GDP_{Real,t,m}=\sum_{i=1}^N P_{i,t-m}Q_{i,t}$
      - $i$: goods and service index; $t$: time index
      - $m$: how many years ago from now, to get the target base year
  - GDP Deflator:
    - a *price index* to convert nominal_GDP ro real_GDP
    - Formula: $GDP \space Deflator=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N P_{i,t}Q_{i,t}}{\sum_{i=1}^N P_{i,t-m}Q_{i,t}} *100= Nominal GDP/Real GDP*100$
  - Per-capita real GDP:
    - measures of *economic well-being* of countries' residents
    - formula: $Real_GDP/Population$
- GDP, National Income, Personal Income, Personal Disposal Income
  - Real GDP components `expenditure` approach: consumption, investment, government spending, net exports(export-import)
    - Formula: $GDP=C+I+G+(X-M)$ OR $GDP=(C+G^C)+(I+G^I)+(X-M)$
      - $G^C$: government consumption
      - $G^I$: government investment(capital goods, inventories)
      - $G$: government purchase
  - Real GDP components `Income` approach: or called **GDI(gross domestic income)**
    - Formula: $GDP=national \space income+ capital \space consumption \space allowance+statistical \space discrepancy$
      - *CCA*: depreciation of physical capital, the amount have to be reinvested to maintain the productivity of physical capital
      - *Statistical discrepancy*: <u>adjustment</u> for GDP under **income and expenditure** approach
      - National Income: all factors of production which distribute to final output
        - `NI=compensation of employees(wages, benefits) + corporate and government enterprise profits before tax + interest income + rent + business owners' income + indirect business taxes- subsidies`
      - Personal income: 
        - <u>pretax</u> income received by household, one determinate of <u>consumer purchasing power</u> and consumption
        - includes all income that household receives, including government transfer payments
      - Household/personal disposable income: 
        - personal income after tax
        - indicator of the ability of consumers to <u>spend and save</u>
        - the amount of money households have ability to save or spend
- Saving, Investment, Fiscal Balance, and Trade Balance
  - The relationship
    - in terms of total income, $GDP=C+S+T$, $S$: household and business savings, $T$: net taxes, $C$: consumption spending
    - Total income=total expenditure: $C+I+G+(X-M)=C+S+T$ -> Rewrite the formula: $S=I+(G-T)+(X-M)$
      - $(G-T)$: fiscal balance, government spending-tax receipts
        - $(G-T)< 0$: budget surplus
        - $(G-T)>0$: budget deficit
      - $(X-M)$: net export, trade balance. The sign of it means trade surplus and negative surplus
    - Rewrite the formula: $(G-T)=(S-I)-(X-M)$
