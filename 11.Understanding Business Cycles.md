# Reading11 Understanding Business Cycles

## 1. Phases

- Business Cycle Description and Phases
  - Business cycle:
    - fluctuations in economic activity,有时几年有时多于十年
    - determinate factors:
      - Real GDP
      - unemployment rate
      - Others: industrial production, real personal income
    - 4 phases and performances:
      - expansion:
        - real GDP, employment, business investment increasing
        - Signal: after **2 consecutive quarters** of growth in real GDP->begin of an expansion
      - peak:
        - real GDP stops increasing and starts decreasing
        - spending, investment, employment <u>increase slow but remain positive</u>, inflation accelerates
      - contraction or recession:
        - real GDP decreasing
        - inflation decrease, <u>declines</u> in spending, investment, employment
        - Signal: after **2 consecutive quarters** of declining in real GDP->begin of an contraction
      - trough:
        - real GDP stops decreasing and begins increasing
        - new expansion begins and recovery
        - economic growth becomes positive and inflation is moderate
- Credit Cycle
  - Definition: 周期性波动in interest rates and the availability of loans(credit)
  - 在不同周期的表现：
    - expansions: lenders are willing to lend and offer lower interest rates
    - contraction: less willing to lend and require higher interest rates
  - Influence:
    - amplify business cycles
      - during expansion, widely available or loose credit condition->bubbles
        - eg: 2007-2009 financial crisis due to subprime mortgages
      - When the credit cycle <u>coincide</u> with business cycle, the business cycle becomes stronger, deeper, and longer lasting
      - When they <u>not coincide</u>, credit cycle has <u>longer duration</u> than business cycle.
- Resources Use, Business Activity, Consumer, Housing Sector Activity, External Trade Sector Activity Vary with Business Cycle
  - Resources Use and Business Activity Fluctuation
    - Resources: Indicator: **Inventory-sales ratio**
      - in time of steady economic growth: inventory-sales ratio trends to normal level
      - expansion reaches to peak, it above normal level
        - Firms responsive: reduce production-->subsequence contraction in economy
      - contraction reaches trough, it decreases below normal level-->to meet increase in demand, firms increase output
    - Business Activity: utilization of labor and physical capital
      - Labors
        - both add or subtracting workers may costly for firms with direct expenses and morale/loyalty damage.
        - <u>Utilize current workers</u> by productivity requirements or adjusting working hours
        - only <u>under extreme situation</u> (expansion/contraction), firms consider to hire or lay off workers.
      - Physical Capital
        - frequently buy or sell equipment and plant is costly
        - using **existing** physical capital more or less intensively to adjust production level normally.
        - expansion persist: investment more in PPE
        - contractions: *not directly sell PPE*, instead firms spend less on <u>maintenance</u> or delay the <u>replacement</u> of equipment near the end of useful life.
  - Consumer Sector Activity(largest component in GDP)
    - spending depends on consumer current income and expectations about future incomes
    - spending ↓ during contractions, ↑ during expansions
    - In different product sectors
      - Durable goods耐用品
        - 很强的周期性,high-value purchase
          - *purchase more* during expansion, *delay purchases* during contraction until they have enough confidence about employment status and income growth
      - Services
        - positively correlated with business cycle phases
        - the more discretionary a service is, the more cyclical consumer spending on its tend to be.服务越具有自主性，周期性消费越明显。
          - more discretionary: food, lodging
          - less discretionary: healthcare, insurance
      - Nondurable goods
        - relative stable during business cycle
  - Housing Sector Activity, its determinants
    - Mortgage rates: ↓, increase home buying and construction
    - Housing costs relative to income:↑, home buying and construction↑
    - Speculative activity: housing price↑, more constructions and excess building-->price↓, speculative demand↓, housing activity dramatic↓
    - Demographic factors:人口区域流动，年龄构成
      - <u>age from 25~40</u> *positively* related to housing sector activity
      - large <u>population shift</u> from rural to cities in China
  - External Trade(import and export) Sector Activity
    - factors
      - domestic GDP growth:↑, import↑
      - GDP growth of trading partners: ↑, export ↑
      - currency exchange rate: 本国货币相对升值↑, export↓, import ↑
        - the effect is more *indirect and persistent* than the first two.

- Theories of Business Cycles
  - Neoclassical School
    - Shift in AD and AS primarily driven by **technology**
    - economy has a strong tendency toward <u>full-employment equilibrium</u>
    - business cycle results from <u>temporary deviations</u> from long-run equilibrium
    - 1930s financial crisis against this idea
  - Keynesian School
    - Shift in AD and AS primarily due to <u>changes in expectations</u> causing business cycle
    - fluctuations due to <u>swing optimism level</u> of who run the business
      - too optimistic about future GDP growth->overinvest and overproduce
      - too pessimistic->under-invest and underproduce
    - Suggestions: 
      - increase AD *directly* through `monetary policy or fiscal policy`
      - against the idea of using `wage` as a tool to adjust economy back to full-employment state
  - New Keynesian School
    - against `prices of productive inputs` as a tool to adjust economy back to full-employment state
  - Monetarist School
    - variation in <u>money supply growth rate</u>->variation in AD, causing business cycle
      - eg: inappropriate decisions by monetary authority
      - Recession: caused by external shocks or money supply ↓
      - the AD should be kept stable and growing, central bank should set a steady and predictable increases money supply policy.
  - Austrian School
    - business cycles are caused by <u>government intervention</u> in economy, called `malinvestment`, the misdirection of capital资产的错误投入
      - eg: government <u>decrease interest rates</u>, firms invest too much capital, compared to actual demand.--> the investment return performs worse, the firm decrease output-->cause *contraction*
  - New Classical School
    - introduce **real business cycle theory(RBC)**
      - effect of real economic variables, such as changes in technology and external shocks, except the monetary variables
    - policymakers should <u>not try to response</u> to the business cycle, thanks to the <u>efficient market</u> response to real external shock.



## 2. Inflation and Indicators

- Economic indicators
  - leading indicator
    - Timing: change direction before peaks or troughs in business cycle
    - index
      - average weekly hours in manufacturing
      - initial claims for unemployment insurance
      - manufacture's new orders for consumer goods, for non-defense capital goods ex-aircraft
      - building permits for new houses
      - S&P500 equity price index
      - leading credit index
      - 10-year Treasury to Fed funds interest rate spread
      - consumer expectations
      - Institute for Supply Management new order Index
  - coincident indicator
    - Timing: change direction at the same time as peaks or troughs
    - index
      - Employees on nonfarm payrolls
      - real personal income
      - index of industrial production
      - manufacturing and trade sales
  - lagging indicator
    - Timing: do not tend to change direction until after expansions or contraction
    - index
      - Average duration of unemployment
      - inventory-sales ratio
      - change in unit labor cost
      - average prime lending rate
      - commercial and industrial loans
      - ratio of consumer installment debt to income
      - change in consumer price index
  - Use these indicators together to *determine the phrase of business cycle*.(Goal)
    - if there <u>exists composite indexes</u>, 需要具体情况具体分析，不能武断的下定义，一般是看大多数同类indicator的表现。
  - reflect tendencies in the **timing** of their turning points
  - We should <u>avoid look-ahead bias</u> when using economic indicators in forecasting models(time gap). The data are not available immediately.
- Types of Unemployment and Different Measurements
  - Types
    - Frictional:the <u>time lag</u> necessary to match employees and employers
    - Structural: long-run changes in economy that eliminate some jobs and generate others which unemployed workers are not qualified.
    - Cyclical: caused by the changes of economic activity(business cycle相关)
      - unemployment increase, when economy operates less than full capacity
      - unemployment decrease, when economy expansion
  - Measurement
    - Unemployed person: who is not working but actively searching for a job. If it is work unsuccessfully for several months called *long-term unemployed*.
    - unemployment rate: percentage of people in `labor force` who are unemployed
      - labor force:all people who either unemployed and employed. 
      - Voluntarily unemployed: people who choose not to be in the labor force, excluded in unemployment rate calculation.
    - underemployed: people who is employed part time but prefer to work full time,or paid by low salary despite being qualified for a higher paid job.
    - participation ratio: 
      - also called activity ratio or labor force participation rate. 
      - The percentage of working-age population who are employed or actively seeking employment.
    - discouraged workers: 
      - Definition: who are available for work but neither employed nor actively seeking employment, causing short-term fluctuation of participation ratio
      - they stop seeking jobs during a recession, and more motivated to seek again when expansion, out of and back into labor force
      - leads to unemployment rate to be a <u>lagging indicator</u> of business cycle
        - Another reason: firms turn to be **slow** to hire or lay off workers at business cycle <u>tunning points</u>. This phenomena can be seen as *productivity* or *output per hour worked* indicator.
        - Solution for lagging: use `the number of employees on payrolls` as indicator
  - the employment indicators are only mentioned to <u>legal employment</u>. However, the illegal sectors are not included.
- Explain inflation, hyperinflation, disinflation, deflation
  - Inflation: 
    - Definition: persistent increase in the price level over time持续性，大范围
    - Influence: 
      - erodes the purchasing power of a currency
      - favor borrowers at the expense of lender当borrower把本金还给lender的时候
  - Hyperinflation: inflation out of control
  - inflation rate: 
    - the percentage increase in price level, normally compared with prior year.
    - can be used as business cycle indicator
  - Disinflation: an inflation rate is *decreasing* over time but still >0.
  - Deflation: 
    - Definition: *persistently* decreasing price level, a *negative* inflation rate. Commonly associated with *deep recessions*.
    - influence: revenue↑ and real fixed costs↓.

- Construction of Indexes
  1. Measurement of Consumer Price Inflation
  - price index: measure the <u>average price</u> for a defined basket of goods and service.
  - CPI Consumer Price Index: 
    - represent the <u>purchasing patterns</u> of typical urban household.  
    - Formula: $CPI=$cost of **basket** at **current** prices/cost of basket at **base** period price *100%
    - Comparison between different region is difficult:
      - the purchasing patterns are different
      - the data collection methods are different.
  - Price Index for Personal Consumption Expenditures
  - GDP Deflator
  2. Emerging Trends: Producer Prices
  - Producer Price Index(PPI)
    - for different stages of processing(raw materials, intermediate goods, finished goods) to watch for emerging price pressure
    - Sub-index of PPI: as an indicator of changes in relative prices of producers' inputs, ie: the shifts in demand
  - Wholesale Price Index(WPI)
  3. Headline or core inflation:
  - Headline inflation: prices indexes for all goods
  - Core inflation: prices indexes exclude food and energy
    - food and energy pricing are more volatile than other
    - more useful as an <u>underlying trend</u> in prices

- Inflation measures
  - Laspeyres Index: be upward biased as a cost of living
    - Three factors
      - New goods
        - old products replaced by newer, but newers are more expensive
      - Quality changes
        - if the prices increase is caused by *products improved*, not due to inflation
        - **Hedonic pricing**: used to adjust a price index for product quality
      - Substitution: if two goods are substitutes for each other, relatively cheaper good is preferred.
        - Fisher Index: <u>reduce the substitution effects</u> by using a chained or chained weighted price index 
          - *geometric mean* of a Laspeyres index and a `Passche index`
            - Paasche Index: use *current consumption weights*, with price from *base and current* period.
              - `Paasche Index=(Quantity in current period*Current price)/(Quantity in current period * Base price) *100`
              - if there exist substitution effect, Paasche Index< Laspeyres Index

- Cost-push and Demand-pull Inflation
  - Cost-push
    - Reason: AS ↓, caused by real price of production input↑
    - Graph interpretation:
      - SRAS shift right↓, Price↑, with given AD, the equilibrium reaches at the interception, GDP level↓
      - policy responses to increase AD, the new equilibrium reaches at the interception with new SRAS, return to the full-employment GDP level, with a higher price level.
    - Important Factor: 
      - wage pressure, called `wage-push inflation`
        - it emerge when cyclical unemployment is low, because firms are difficult to find enough qualified labors during contraction.
        - identify signs of <u>potential wage pressure</u>: use hourly and weekly earnings and labor productivity data
        - Indicator:**Unit labor cost**: total labor compensation per hour/output per hour
          - to detect whether wage changes is caused by inflation
        - additional source: expected inflation: ↑, wage demand ↑
          - indicator: <u>difference</u> in yield between *inflation-indexed* bonds(eg:Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) and similar *non-indexed Treasury bonds*.
      - **Natural rate of unemployment**(NARU) or **Non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment**(NAIRU) > absence rate of cyclical unemployment
        - NARU: determined by market forces, government can increase it only by causing <u>high rate of inflation</u>
  - Demand-pull
    - Reason: AD ↑, caused by money demand ↑, government spending↑
    - Graph interpretation:
      - AD shift right to AD1, when center bank increases money supply, new equilibrium at higher GDP level and higher price, as the interception point with fixed SRAS.
      - the output cannot be above full-employment GDP level at long run, real wage upward pressure ↑, SRAS ↓ shifts left, until back to full-employment GDP with the new interception at a higher pricing level.
    - Indicator: 
      - **capacity utilization rate of industry**: indicate potential for demand-pull inflation 
        - higher the indicator, implying economy is producing at or above potential GDP, may experience inflation pressure
