# Reading11 Understanding Business Cycles

## 1. Phases

- Business Cycle Description and Phases
  - Business cycle:
    - fluctuations in economic activity,有时几年有时多于十年
    - determinate factors:
      - Real GDP
      - unemployment rate
      - Others: industrial production, real personal income
    - 4 phases and performances:
      - expansion:
        - real GDP, employment, business investment increasing
        - Signal: after **2 consecutive quarters** of growth in real GDP->begin of an expansion
      - peak:
        - real GDP stops increasing and starts decreasing
        - spending, investment, employment <u>increase slow but remain positive</u>, inflation accelerates
      - contraction or recession:
        - real GDP decreasing
        - inflation decrease, <u>declines</u> in spending, investment, employment
        - Signal: after **2 consecutive quarters** of declining in real GDP->begin of an contraction
      - trough:
        - real GDP stops decreasing and begins increasing
        - new expansion begins and recovery
        - economic growth becomes positive and inflation is moderate
- Credit Cycle
  - Definition: 周期性波动in interest rates and the availability of loans(credit)
  - 在不同周期的表现：
    - expansions: lenders are willing to lend and offer lower interest rates
    - contraction: less willing to lend and require higher interest rates
  - Influence:
    - amplify business cycles
      - during expansion, widely available or loose credit condition->bubbles
        - eg: 2007-2009 financial crisis due to subprime mortgages
      - When the credit cycle <u>coincide</u> with business cycle, the business cycle becomes stronger, deeper, and longer lasting
      - When they <u>not coincide</u>, credit cycle has <u>longer duration</u> than business cycle.
- Resources Use, Business Activity, Consumer, Housing Sector Activity, External Trade Sector Activity Vary with Business Cycle
  - Resources Use and Business Activity Fluctuation
    - Resources: Indicator: **Inventory-sales ratio**
      - in time of steady economic growth: inventory-sales ratio trends to normal level
      - expansion reaches to peak, it above normal level
        - Firms responsive: reduce production-->subsequence contraction in economy
      - contraction reaches trough, it decreases below normal level-->to meet increase in demand, firms increase output
    - Business Activity: utilization of labor and physical capital
      - Labors
        - both add or subtracting workers may costly for firms with direct expenses and morale/loyalty damage.
        - <u>Utilize current workers</u> by productivity requirements or adjusting working hours
        - only <u>under extreme situation</u> (expansion/contraction), firms consider to hire or lay off workers.
      - Physical Capital
        - frequently buy or sell equipment and plant is costly
        - using **existing** physical capital more or less intensively to adjust production level normally.
        - expansion persist: investment more in PPE
        - contractions: *not directly sell PPE*, instead firms spend less on <u>maintenance</u> or delay the <u>replacement</u> of equipment near the end of useful life.
  - Consumer Sector Activity(largest component in GDP)
    - spending depends on consumer current income and expectations about future incomes
    - spending ↓ during contractions, ↑ during expansions
    - In different product sectors
      - Durable goods耐用品
        - 很强的周期性,high-value purchase
          - *purchase more* during expansion, *delay purchases* during contraction until they have enough confidence about employment status and income growth
      - Services
        - positively correlated with business cycle phases
        - the more discretionary a service is, the more cyclical consumer spending on its tend to be.服务越具有自主性，周期性消费越明显。
          - more discretionary: food, lodging
          - less discretionary: healthcare, insurance
      - Nondurable goods
        - relative stable during business cycle
  - Housing Sector Activity, its determinants
    - Mortgage rates: ↓, increase home buying and construction
    - Housing costs relative to income:↑, home buying and construction↑
    - Speculative activity: housing price↑, more constructions and excess building-->price↓, speculative demand↓, housing activity dramatic↓
    - Demographic factors:人口区域流动，年龄构成
      - <u>age from 25~40</u> *positively* related to housing sector activity
      - large <u>population shift</u> from rural to cities in China
  - External Trade(import and export) Sector Activity
    - factors
      - domestic GDP growth:↑, import↑
      - GDP growth of trading partners: ↑, export ↑
      - currency exchange rate: 本国货币相对升值↑, export↓, import ↑
        - the effect is more *indirect and persistent* than the first two.

- Theories of Business Cycles
  - Neoclassical School
    - Shift in AD and AS primarily driven by **technology**
    - economy has a strong tendency toward <u>full-employment equilibrium</u>
    - business cycle results from <u>temporary deviations</u> from long-run equilibrium
    - 1930s financial crisis against this idea
  - Keynesian School
    - Shift in AD and AS primarily due to <u>changes in expectations</u> causing business cycle
    - fluctuations due to <u>swing optimism level</u> of who run the business
      - too optimistic about future GDP growth->overinvest and overproduce
      - too pessimistic->under-invest and underproduce
    - Suggestions: 
      - increase AD *directly* through `monetary policy or fiscal policy`
      - against the idea of using `wage` as a tool to adjust economy back to full-employment state
  - New Keynesian School
    - against `prices of productive inputs` as a tool to adjust economy back to full-employment state
  - Monetarist School
    - variation in <u>money supply growth rate</u>->variation in AD, causing business cycle
      - eg: inappropriate decisions by monetary authority
      - Recession: caused by external shocks or money supply ↓
      - the AD should be kept stable and growing, central bank should set a steady and predictable increases money supply policy.
  - Austrian School
    - business cycles are caused by <u>government intervention</u> in economy, called `malinvestment`, the misdirection of capital资产的错误投入
      - eg: government <u>decrease interest rates</u>, firms invest too much capital, compared to actual demand.--> the investment return performs worse, the firm decrease output-->cause *contraction*
  - New Classical School
    - introduce **real business cycle theory(RBC)**
      - effect of real economic variables, such as changes in technology and external shocks, except the monetary variables
    - policymakers should <u>not try to response</u> to the business cycle, thanks to the <u>efficient market</u> response to real external shock.


## 2. Inflation and Indicators

    - Structural 
    - Cyclical
  - Measurement

    - participation ratio
    - discouraged workers
