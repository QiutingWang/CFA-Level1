# Reading12 Monetary and Fiscal Policy

## 1. Money and Inflation

### Compare Monetary and Fiscal Policy

- Fiscal Policy
  - Definition: government uses <u>spending and taxation</u> to influence economic activity.
  - Budget: Condition indicator
    - Balance: tax revenue=government expenditure
    - budget surplus: tax revenue> government expenditure
    - budget deficit: government expenditure> tax revenue
- Monetary Policy
  - Definition: central bank actions affect <u>quantity of money and credit in economy</u> to influence economic activity
  - Situations:
    - Expansionary(accommodative, easy): ↑quantity of money and credit in economy
    - Contractionary(restrictive, tight): ↓quantity of money and credit in economy
- Goal: 
  - maintain *stable prices* and produce positive economic growth
  - Fiscal policy is a tool for *income and wealth redistribution*.

### Money Functions and Definitions

- Definition: generally medium of exchange, facilitating indirect change而不是直接以物易物
- Three Functions:
  1. Medium of exchange, Means of payment: as the payment for goods and services
  2. Unit of account: express the price of goods and services
  3. Store of value : money received for work or goods now can be saved to purchase goods later
- Content:
  - Narrow money: the amount of **notes(currency) or coins** in circulation in economy + balanced checkable bank deposits
  - Broad money: narrow money+ amount in liquid assets which can be used to make purchase
  
  ✅ the difference between these two is <u>liquidity</u>
- Measures of money different from country to country.
  - in the US Federal Bank: depend by different degrees of liquidity
    - $M1$: most liquid forms of money
      - includes currency in public, travelers checks, demand deposits
    - $M2$: includes $M1$, Savings, time deposit< $100000, balances in retail money market mutual funds.
  - in European Central Bank
    - $M1$: currency in circulation, overnight deposit
    - $M2$: $M1$ and, deposits with an agreed maturity up to 2 years, deposits redeemable at notice up to 3 months
    - $M3$: $M1$, $M2$, and repurchase agreements, money market fund shares, debt security issued with a maturity up to 2 years

### Money Creation Process

- Promissory notes: 
  - when use **gold or other precious metal**, deposit them in bank, bank will give you a promissory note, to promise you to return that gold when a demand from depositor.
  - itself act as a medium of exchange
  - 促生了fractional reserving bank: 因为不是一下子所有的deposit withdrawn at the same time, banks start to lend parts of deposit to earn interest.借贷关系生成，银行盈利
    - in most countries, banks are required to set **minimum percentage of deposits as reserve**, expressed as percentage.
    - the part of allowed to loan(excess reserves,cash no need for reserve) can be depositing in bank, until deposits are some <u>multiple</u> of the original cash amount.次贷，次次贷。。。
    - money multiplier=1/reserve requirement ratio
      - $1 of excess reserves can generate a $X increase in the money supply
    - money created=new deposit/reserve requirement ratio
    - if the reserve ratio↓, money created↑,money multiplier↑
- Relationship between money and price level
  - quantity theory of money
    - quantity of money is some proportion of the total spending in an economy
    - Formula: `money supply * velocity = price * real output`($MV=PY$)
      - $PY$: total spending
      - $V$: average number of times per year each unit of money is used to buy goods or services.
      - $Y$ and $V$ in reality change slowly, they are <u>money neutrality</u> (not affected by monetary variables). Hence, if these two remain constant, $M$↑ and $P$↑ proportionally.
        - some researchers believe that <u>monetary policy</u> can be used to control and regulate <u>inflation</u>.

### Demand for Money and Supply of Money

- Demand for Money:
  - Definition: the amount of wealth household and firms choose to hold in form of money.
  - Three reasons for holding money:
    - Transaction demand: real GDP↑, size and number of transactions ↑, demand for money↑
    - Precautionary demand预防性: for unforeseen future needs. It is higher for larger firms. Size of economy ↑, demand for money ↑.
    - Speculative demand投机:
      - take advantage of investment opportunities arise in the future. 
      - Higher returns, more speculative money holding. Negatively related with returns
      - positively related to perceived risk in other financial instruments. Higher risk, more speculative money holding demand.
  - Relationship between *short-term interest rates* and *quantity of money*(negatively related)
    - interests rate↑, opportunity costs of holding money↑, holding money↓, i*nterest bearing financial assets*↑.
    - Graph interpretation:
      - X-axis: quantity of money; Y-axis: Nominal interest rate
      - Vertical line: Money Supply 
      - downward sloping: Money Demand
      - Interception: at $i^*$ nominal interest rate level.
        - $> i^*$:at $i_{high}$, excess supply of money-->purchase in securities
        - $< i^*$:at $i_{low}$,at $i_{low}$, excess demand for money-->sales of securities
- Supply of Money:
  - Definition: determined by central bank, independent of interest rates


### Fisher Effect

- Definition: `nominal interest rate` is sum of the `real interest rate` and `expected inflation`
- Formula: $R_{Norm}=R_{Real}+E[I]$
  - $E[I]$: expected inflation
- Intuition: real rates are relative stable, hence, $\Delta R_{Norm} \sim \Delta E[I]$
- Expansion of the formula: $R_{Norm}=R_{Real}+E[I]+RP$
  - $RP$: risk premium for uncertainty
  - Intuition: investors are exposed to the inflation risk and other future outcomes, they <u>require additional return as risk premium</u> for bearing the risk.


### Central Bank Role and Goals

- Role:
  - Sole authorized supplier of currency
    - fiat money法定货币，不兑现货币:
      - money not backed by any tangible value
      - if it holds its value and acceptable for transactions, can be treated as <u>medium of exchange</u>.
  - Banker to the government and other banks: provide banking services to these entities.
  - Regulator and supervisor of payment system
    - impose standards of risk-taking allowed
    - impose reserve requirements
    - oversee payment system domestically and international transactions
  - Lender of last resort最后贷款人: 
    - print money for supplying money shortage banks with sufficient money
    - government prevents running on banks(large scale withdrawals银行挤兑),来保证存款人的资产安全
  - Conductor of monetary policy: control and influence **quantity of money supplied** in an economy and **growth** of money supply数量和变化
  - Holder of gold and foreign currency exchange reserve
- Objective: 
  - control inflation to make price stability
    - the target inflation rate over world set: 2%~3%
      - While, US and Japan *do not set* the inflation targets
        - US: Fed has additional goals of `maximum employment` and moderate l`ong-term interests rate`
        - Japan: deflation over years
    - if set target is 0, increasing <u>risk of deflation</u>
  - stable in *exchange rates* with foreign currencies
    - **Pegging**: some countries choose a target level of their own currency with other country's, 一般是与美元挂钩(有一个参照物)
    - Adjustment: 
      - in short term, if own currency appreciates(relatively valuable)->sell domestic currency reserves for dollars-> reduce exchange rate
      - in long term, interest rate stabilization and healthy economic activity are essential.
    - Rule: 挂钩和被挂钩的inflation rate基本相同
  - full *employment*
  - sustainable positive *economic growth*
  - moderate *long-term interest rates*

### Costs of Expected and Unexpected Inflation

- The costs of unexpected inflation(actual inflation rate higher or lower than expected)> cost of `perfectly expected`(expected=actual) aggregated inflation
  - <u>Higher borrowing rate</u> is required, to face the unexpected changes in inflation
    - actual > expected: borrower gain, payment in the future< value in real term
    - actual < expected: lender gain
  - information about <u>supply and demand from price changes</u> less reliable.工厂对真实需求量的判断
- <u>cost of holding money</u> instead of cost of interest-bearing securities is ↑, owing to money purchasing power ↓
- Technology and internet have *decreased money movement costs*, which points to the costs of money movement from interest-bearing securities→cash.

## 2. Monetary Policy

### Three Tools

1. Policy rate: 
   - the rate commercial banks can borrow reserves from the Fed, called *discounted rate* or *refinancing rate*(European).
   - the way to <u>lend money to commercial bank</u>: *repurchase agreement*
     - commercial bank repurchases securities from central bank at **higher** price in future
     - The **difference** between purchase and repurchase price: effective <u>rate</u> which central bank is <u>lending</u> to member commercial banks.→*Two-week repo(repurchase) rate.*
       - The lower two-week repo rate, encourage lending, reduce banks' cost of funds.
   - *Federal fund rate*: banks charge each other on overnight loans of reserves
     - Government <u>set target</u> to this rate, use *open market operations* to adjust this rate at target.
2. Reserve requirement
   - ↑, the money supply for lending↓, interest rate↑
3. Open market operation(most commonly use in US)
   - Definition: buy or sell of securities by <u>central bank</u>
     - **Buy** securities, for investors cash↑ securities on hand↓, for banks money reserves↑, funds available for lending↑, money supply↑, interest rate↓
     - **Sell** opposite

### Monetary Transmission Mechanism

- Definition: ways to change *monetary policy*, specially central bank *policy rate*, affects price level and inflation.
- 4 Channels: [Assumption: policy rate↑]
  1. Bank short term lending rates: 
     - ↑, customer credit purchases↓, firms new investment↓, aggregate demand↓
  2. Asset value, bonds or equity prices: 
     - ↓, saving rate for household↑, consumption↓
  3. Currency exchange rate
     - domestic currency relative to foreign currency↑, exports↓
  4. Expectations
     - consumers' or firms' future economic growth expectation↓, expenditure↓
  - In total, policy rate↑, aggregate demand↓, price level↓

### Relationship between Monetary Policy and Economic Growth, Inflation, Interest, Exchange Rate

- Assumption: [More Expansionary Monetary Policy]
- Short Run Influence:
  - central bank buy securities, bank reserves↑
  - interbank lending rate(Federal fund rate)↓
    - market rate↓
    - asset price↑, lower discount rate to compute PV
    - firms and households raise future economic growth expectation
    - domestic currency relative to foreign currency↓
  - short-term rates↓, cuz of supply of loanable funds↑, equilibrium rate of loans↓
  - longer-term rates↓
  - real interest rates↓, domestic currency relative to foreign currency↓, export↑, net export↑
  - business investment in PPE↑, customer consumption↑-->aggregate demand↑
  - inflation, employment, real GDP↑

### Effect Central Bank Qualities: Whether Succeed in Inflation-targeting Policy

- Independence:
  - central bank is free from political interference
  - relatively, not absolutely
  - Evaluation: 
    - operational dependency: central bank decides policy rates independently
    - target dependency: central bank decides target inflation level, how inflation computed, horizon over which target is to achieve
- Credibility:
  - 言行一致follow through on their stated intentions
  - 自证预言what central bank believes will actually happen later
- Transparency
  - issue **inflation report** to disclose the state of economic environment periodically with important economic indicators.

### Central Banks Targeting Inflation, Interest Rate, Exchange Rate

- Interest Rate Targeting
  - money supply↑, interest rate above target band
- Inflation Targeting
  - most common inflation rate=2%, band [1%, 3%]
    - not around 0%, for avoiding deflation
  - not target current inflation, but in range of 2 years in the future
- Exchange Rate Targeting
  - developing countries prefer to make this target
  - if actual domestic currency ↓ below the required rate, authority will use <u>foreign reserves</u> to **purchase** domestic currency.
  - Advantage: volatility of money supply ↑
  - Disadvantage: how much influence currency buy/sell can have on exchange rate adjustment is unsure.
    - Sometimes, government <u>run out of foreign reserves</u>, but actual exchange rate still *below target*.
  - Effect: targeting country inflation rate=targeted country inflation rate
  - leads exchange rate targeting least responsive to domestic economic conditions

### Expansionary and Contractionary Monetary Policy

- Real trend rate: long-term sustainable real growth rate, which should be estimated.
- `Neutral interest rate = real trend rate of economic growth+inflation target`
  - growth rate of money supply
- Contractionary(Expansionary) policy: policy rate<(>)neutral interest rate
  - they should be executed corresponds to <u>source of inflation</u>
  - in US, government focus on *core inflation*(except volatile food and energy price)

### Monetary Policy Limitations

- Monetary policy does not always produce intended results, because of policies focusing on <u>expected inflation</u>
- if monetary policy too *tighten*, it will increase probability of *recession.*-->long-term **bonds** more attractive, long-term interest rates↓
  - central bank expansionary ability is limited, owing to cannot reduce policy rate=0
  - monetary policies will fail to achieve when deflation
- Liquidity trap: demand for money becomes *elastic*, individuals hold more money流动性陷阱
  - money supply↑ ×→ short-term rates
- Even excess reserves, banks may not be willing to lend
  - Solution: quantitative easing policy
    - UK: large purchases of <u>government bonds</u> in maturity range of 3~5 years→reduce interest rate→encourage borrowing; →generate excess reserves→encourage lending
    - US: large amount of dollars of Fed to buy <u>assets</u>
      - QE2: Fed purchases <u>long-term Treasury bonds</u> in large quantity and <u>securities with credit risk</u>, *shifting risk* from private investors to public investors

## 3. Fiscal Policy

### Fiscal Policy Roles and Objectives

- Definition: use of spending and taxation to meet macroeconomic goals
  - Discretional Fiscal Policy: government uses spending and taxation to *stabilize* the economy
  - automatic stabilizer: built-in fiscal devices triggered by the state of economy
- Status of government budget:
  - Balanced: tax revenue=government expenditure
  - Surplus: >
  - Deficit: <
- Objective:
  - influence level of economic activity and aggregate demand
  - income and wealth redistribution
  - allocate resources among economic agents and sectors

### Relationship between Size of National Debt and GDP

- country's Debt Ratio: 
  - Calculation: `Debt Ratio=aggregate debt/GDP`
- Arguments *in favor of* caring about size of fiscal deficit
  - deficit↑, future taxes↑-->work and entrepreneurship↓, long-term economic growth↓
  - lose confidence in government, investors would not to refinance the debt→government defaulting, simple print money→inflation↑
  - interest rate↑, firms borrowing and investment↓, aggregate demand↓, **crowding-out effect**(public→private)
- Argument *against with* caring for size of fiscal deficit
  - debt is held by domestic citizens
  - if the debt is used to <u>finance productive capital investment</u>, the future gains will be sufficient to repay.
  - if economy is operating *< full capacity*, deficits not divert capital away from *productive uses*.
  - fiscal deficit may lead to <u>tax reform</u>
  - deficit will be eliminate if private sector savings with future tax liabilities offset deficit
  - deficit can boost GDP and employment

### Tools, Advantages, and Disadvantages

#### Fiscal Tools: Spending + Revenue

- Spending
  - Transfer Payment
    - not include in GDP calculation
    - entitlement programs, redistribution wealth
    - Social Security and Unemployment insurance
      - provide a <u>minimum standard of living</u>
  - Current Spending: 
    - *government purchases* of goods and services on <u>ongoing and routine basis</u>.
      - provide <u>national defense</u> service
  - Capital Spending: 
    - government spends on <u>infrastructure</u> to boost future productivity.
      - invest in *R&D* for certain *high-risk ventures*, like green technology
- Revenue
  - Types
    - Direct Tax
      - based on income or wealth
      - some <u>progress tax</u> generate revenue for redistribution.
    - Indirect Tax
      - based on goods or service
      - eg: sales tax, value-added tax(VAT), excise tax
      - reduce consumption of some goods and service(alcohol, tobacco, gambling)
  - Attributes:
    - simply
    - efficiently, least interact with market force
    - fairness
      - horizontal equality: in similar situations pay similar taxes
      - vertical equality: richer, more payment
    - sufficiently: generate revenue for government spending.
- Evaluation of Fiscal Tools
  - Advantages
    - <u>social policies</u> discourages tobacco consumption can be implied by indirect taxes
    - quick implementation *without additional costs* to generate revenue
  - Disadvantages
    - take time to implement, effects of fiscal policies delay
  - Effectiveness
    - spending tools are most effective in increasing aggregate demand
    - tax reduction for people with low incomes will be more effective in increasing aggregate demand
- Fiscal Multiplier
  - magnitude of effect depends on <u>tax rate</u> and <u>marginal propensity to consume</u>(MPC) iteratively.
    - MPC: additional spending part relative to disposal income
      - Disposal income: income after tax
  - Formula: $FM=\frac{1}{1-MPC(1-t)}$
  - each iteration, additional spending amount↓, effects have limit.
  - It determines how much potential ↑ in AD, owing to government spending↑
  - MPC ↑, FM ↑; t ↑, FM ↓
- Balanced Budget Multiplier
  - multiplier effects can be also described: a direct government spending↑ and the overall AD ↓ for tax increase
- Ricardian Equivalence

### Implementation and Difficulties

- Discretionary fiscal policy: fiscal policy is done by changing in **taxes and spending**
- economic forests might be wrong-->incorrect policy decisions
- lags
  - Recognition lag:
    - decisions are made by political process. *Policymakers need time* to recognize the nature and extent of economic problems.
  - Action lag: time to discuss, vote on, and enact fiscal policy changes.
  - Impact lag: time difference between policy changes enactment and changes on economy actually takes place
- Misleading economic statistics
  - full employment level is not accurately measurable
- Crowding-out effect:
  - expansionary policies will crowd out private investment
- Supply shortages: 
  - if economic development slows down because of <u>lack of resources</u>, expansionary fiscal policies leads to *higher inflation* and fail to boost economic development.
- Limits to deficits: 
  - if there is higher deficit related to GDP. *Funding the deficit* will be *difficult* leads to higher interest rates.
- Multiple targets: 
  - if high unemployment and intensive inflation exist, government cannot ease problems at the same time.

### Judge Whether an Expansionary or Contractionary Fiscal Policy

- Depend on **changes in the surplus or deficit** to determine if the fiscal policy is expansionary or contractionary.
  - surplus(deficit)↑, contractionary(expansionary) fiscal policy.
  - tax revenue(spending items)↑, contractionary(expansionary) fiscal policy.
- **Structural(cyclical adjusted) budget deficit**: use to measure fiscal policy.

### Monetary and Fiscal Policy Interaction

- Expansionary fiscal and monetary policy
  - interest rate↓, private and public expand.
- Contractionary fiscal and monetary policy
  - AD and GDP↓, interest rate↑, private and public contract.
- Expansionary fiscal and Contractionary monetary policy
  - AD↑, interest rate(tight monetary policy, government borrowing increase)↑, Government spending of GDP component↑
- Contractionary fiscal and expansionary monetary policy
  - interest rate↓-->private sector↑, Government Spending of GDP component↓
