# Reading12 Monetary and Fiscal Policy

## 1. Money and Inflation

### Compare Monetary and Fiscal Policy

- Fiscal Policy
  - Definition: government uses <u>spending and taxation</u> to influence economic activity.
  - Budget: Condition indicator
    - Balance: tax revenue=government expenditure
    - budget surplus: tax revenue> government expenditure
    - budget deficit: government expenditure> tax revenue
- Monetary Policy
  - Definition: central bank actions affect <u>quantity of money and credit in economy</u> to influence economic activity
  - Situations:
    - Expansionary(accommodative, easy): ↑quantity of money and credit in economy
    - Contractionary(restrictive, tight): ↓quantity of money and credit in economy
- Goal: 
  - maintain *stable prices* and produce positive economic growth
  - Fiscal policy is a tool for *income and wealth redistribution*.

### Money Functions and Definitions

- Definition: generally medium of exchange, facilitating indirect change而不是直接以物易物
- Three Functions:
  1. Medium of exchange, Means of payment: as the payment for goods and services
  2. Unit of account: express the price of goods and services
  3. Store of value : money received for work or goods now can be saved to purchase goods later
- Content:
  - Narrow money: the amount of **notes(currency) or coins** in circulation in economy + balanced checkable bank deposits
  - Broad money: narrow money+ amount in liquid assets which can be used to make purchase
  
  ✅ the difference between these two is <u>liquidity</u>
- Measures of money different from country to country.
  - in the US Federal Bank: depend by different degrees of liquidity
    - $M1$: most liquid forms of money
      - includes currency in public, travelers checks, demand deposits
    - $M2$: includes $M1$, Savings, time deposit< $100000, balances in retail money market mutual funds.
  - in European Central Bank
    - $M1$: currency in circulation, overnight deposit
    - $M2$: $M1$ and, deposits with an agreed maturity up to 2 years, deposits redeemable at notice up to 3 months
    - $M3$: $M1$, $M2$, and repurchase agreements, money market fund shares, debt security issued with a maturity up to 2 years

### Money Creation Process

- Promissory notes: 
  - when use **gold or other precious metal**, deposit them in bank, bank will give you a promissory note, to promise you to return that gold when a demand from depositor.
  - itself act as a medium of exchange
  - 促生了fractional reserving bank: 因为不是一下子所有的deposit withdrawn at the same time, banks start to lend parts of deposit to earn interest.借贷关系生成，银行盈利
    - in most countries, banks are required to set **minimum percentage of deposits as reserve**, expressed as percentage.
    - the part of allowed to loan(excess reserves,cash no need for reserve) can be depositing in bank, until deposits are some <u>multiple</u> of the original cash amount.次贷，次次贷。。。
    - money multiplier=1/reserve requirement ratio
      - $1 of excess reserves can generate a $X increase in the money supply
    - money created=new deposit/reserve requirement ratio
    - if the reserve ratio↓, money created↑,money multiplier↑
- Relationship between money and price level
  - quantity theory of money
    - quantity of money is some proportion of the total spending in an economy
    - Formula: `money supply * velocity = price * real output`($MV=PY$)
      - $PY$: total spending
      - $V$: average number of times per year each unit of money is used to buy goods or services.
      - $Y$ and $V$ in reality change slowly, they are <u>money neutrality</u> (not affected by monetary variables). Hence, if these two remain constant, $M$↑ and $P$↑ proportionally.
        - some researchers believe that <u>monetary policy</u> can be used to control and regulate <u>inflation</u>.

### Demand for Money and Supply of Money

- Demand for Money:
  - Definition: the amount of wealth household and firms choose to hold in form of money.
  - Three reasons for holding money:
    - Transaction demand: real GDP↑, size and number of transactions ↑, demand for money↑
    - Precautionary demand预防性: for unforeseen future needs. It is higher for larger firms. Size of economy ↑, demand for money ↑.
    - Speculative demand投机:
      - take advantage of investment opportunities arise in the future. 
      - Higher returns, more speculative money holding. Negatively related with returns
      - positively related to perceived risk in other financial instruments. Higher risk, more speculative money holding demand.
  - Relationship between *short-term interest rates* and *quantity of money*(negatively related)
    - interests rate↑, opportunity costs of holding money↑, holding money↓, i*nterest bearing financial assets*↑.
    - Graph interpretation:
      - X-axis: quantity of money; Y-axis: Nominal interest rate
      - Vertical line: Money Supply 
      - downward sloping: Money Demand
      - Interception: at $i^*$ nominal interest rate level.
        - $> i^*$:at $i_{high}$, excess supply of money-->purchase in securities
        - $< i^*$:at $i_{low}$,at $i_{low}$, excess demand for money-->sales of securities
- Supply of Money:
  - Definition: determined by central bank, independent of interest rates


### Fisher Effect

- Definition: `nominal interest rate` is sum of the `real interest rate` and `expected inflation`
- Formula: $R_{Norm}=R_{Real}+E[I]$
  - $E[I]$: expected inflation
- Intuition: real rates are relative stable, hence, $\Delta R_{Norm} \sim \Delta E[I]$
- Expansion of the formula: $R_{Norm}=R_{Real}+E[I]+RP$
  - $RP$: risk premium for uncertainty
  - Intuition: investors are exposed to the inflation risk and other future outcomes, they <u>require additional return as risk premium</u> for bearing the risk.


### Central Bank Role and Goals

- Role:
  - Sole authorized supplier of currency
    - fiat money法定货币，不兑现货币:
      - money not backed by any tangible value
      - if it holds its value and acceptable for transactions, can be treated as <u>medium of exchange</u>.
  - Banker to the government and other banks: provide banking services to these entities.
  - Regulator and supervisor of payment system
    - impose standards of risk-taking allowed
    - impose reserve requirements
    - oversee payment system domestically and international transactions
  - Lender of last resort最后贷款人: 
    - print money for supplying money shortage banks with sufficient money
    - government prevents running on banks(large scale withdrawals银行挤兑),来保证存款人的资产安全
  - Conductor of monetary policy: control and influence **quantity of money supplied** in an economy and **growth** of money supply数量和变化
  - Holder of gold and foreign currency exchange reserve
- Objective: 
  - control inflation to make price stability
    - the target inflation rate over world set: 2%~3%
      - While, US and Japan *do not set* the inflation targets
        - US: Fed has additional goals of `maximum employment` and moderate l`ong-term interests rate`
        - Japan: deflation over years
    - if set target is 0, increasing <u>risk of deflation</u>
  - stable in *exchange rates* with foreign currencies
    - **Pegging**: some countries choose a target level of their own currency with other country's, 一般是与美元挂钩(有一个参照物)
    - Adjustment: 
      - in short term, if own currency appreciates(relatively valuable)->sell domestic currency reserves for dollars-> reduce exchange rate
      - in long term, interest rate stabilization and healthy economic activity are essential.
    - Rule: 挂钩和被挂钩的inflation rate基本相同
  - full *employment*
  - sustainable positive *economic growth*
  - moderate *long-term interest rates*
