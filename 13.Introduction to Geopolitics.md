- Forecast the influences on investment, the aspects we need to focus on:
  - likelihood, *probability* 
    - countries with cooperative and globalized trend↑ → likelihood of geopolitical risk↓
  - *magnitude* of effects on investment, impact

      - when countries are in <u>recessions</u>, *impact* of risk affects *more* than during an expansion.
  - *velocity*, how quickly reflect the effect 
- Investors Actions:
  - *scenario analysis* to measure the <u>impact</u>
  - care about *signposts*, to identify <u>likelihood</u> of an event increase or decrease
