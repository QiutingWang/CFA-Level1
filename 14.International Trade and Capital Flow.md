# Reading 14 International Trade and Capital Flows

## 1. International Trade Benefit

### 1) Some Terms

- World price: price in <u>world markets</u> for those to whom trade without restriction.
- Domestic price: price in domestic country. 
  - It can be the same as or different from the world price, depending on whether there exists trade restriction or not.
- Trade surplus: net export>0
- Trade deficit: net export<0
- Autarky/Closed Economy: a country doesn't trade with other countries
- Free Trade: counties place **no** restrictions or charges on import or export activity.
  - Contrast: Trade protection
- Terms of Trade:
  - price of country's export/price of country's import, base 100.
- Foreign Direct Investment: ownership of <u>productive resources</u> in a foreign country


### 2) Gross Domestic Product & Gross National Product

- GDP: 
  - Definition: over a period, total value of goods and services produced within country's border.
- GNP:
  - Definition: produced by the <u>labor and capital</u> of country's citizens
  - The income of country's citizen working abroad is included in GNP, but not in GDP.

### 3) Cost and Benefit of International Trade

- Benefit
  - For exporting countries: employment↑, wage of workers↑, profit from export products↑
  - For importing countries: cost to purchase goods↓
- Cost
  - For importing countries:
    - Domestic industries compete with imported goods
    - workers lose their jobs, unemployment↑, or are be sent to retrain
- Overall, benefit>cost.

### 4) Comparative Advantage VS. Absolute Advantage

- Absolute advantage: 
  - Definition: produce a goods which have a <u>lower cost</u> than another country.
- Comparative advantage:
  - Definition: produce a goods which have a <u>lower opportunity costs</u>, which represented by the amount of *another good* that could have been produced.
    - Opportunity cost calculation:
      - OC of product1=amount of product2/amount of product1
      - the lower OC, the greater comparative advantage in that product.
  - if each country *pays more time* in production of the *good which has comparative advantage*, the total gains from trade↑, total output↑, comes to a greater specialization.
  - The <u>negotiation term</u> decides how to *divide* the gains to two countries.
- **Production Possibility Frontier**
  - X-axis: product2 production units; Y-axis: product1 production units.
  - shows all combinations of product1 and product2 that a economy can produce
  - Slope<0: the opportunity cost of one unit of product2 in terms of k units of product1

### 5) Ricardian Model & Heckscher-Ohlin Model

- Ricardian Model
  - only one production factor: *labor*
  - Difference in production cost←differences in <u>labor productivity</u>←difference in <u>technology</u>
- Heckscher-Ohlin Model
  - two production factors: *capital and labor*
  - differences in opportunity costs←differences in relative amount of each factor
  - exists a <u>redistribution of wealth</u> between labor and owners of capital
    - the price of good which country *imports↓*, the price of good which country *export↑*
    - the price of relatively *less scarce factor* in production↑(出口)

## 2. Trade Restrictions

### 1) Types of Trade, Types of Capital Restriction, Economic Implication

- Reasons for Trade Restrictions
  - Infant industry: 
    - protection from foreign competition
    - for getting up <u>learning curve</u> with efficient production methods提高生产效率
    - grow to a international competitive scale国际化规模
  - National security
    - protect the goods are essential to <u>national defense</u>, making them *available domestically* to be applied in events of conflicts
- Reasons against Trade Restrictions
  - free trade will *create jobs* in export industries
  - the *prices* of domestic consumers will be *less* without trade restrictions
  - if firms protected by government will take advantage of *politic influence*, asking customers for a *higher price*.

- Types & Definitions of Trade Restrictions
  - Tariffs
    - taxes of imported goods collected by local government
  - Quotas
    - limited amount of imported goods in a period of time
  - Export Subsidies
    - government payments to firms who export goods
  - Minimum domestic content
    - require some percentages of product component must be from domestic
  - Voluntary export restraints
    - to avoid tariffs or limited quotas asked by trading partners.
- Effects of Trade Restrictions
  - Tariffs
    - Q of imported goods↓, domestic P of imported goods↑, domestic supply of imported goods↑
    - domestic government is gained by tariffs revenue
  - Quotas
    - domestic price↑
    - domestic producers gain, domestic consumer lose
    - if `import licenses` which is granted by domestic government are sold, domestic government gains revenue.
    - Quota Rents:
      - if domestic government doesn't charge for import licenses, this amount of gains belong to <u>foreign exporters who receive import licenses</u>.
  - Effect of Tariffs and Quotas
    - X-axis: Q; Y-axis: P; Domestic Demand & Domestic Supply
    - Assumption: the effect of tariffs and quotas limits *are the same* between price and demand change
    - Price increment: $P_{world}$→$P_{protection}$ with correspond $QD_1$、$QS_1$ and $QD_2$ 、$QS_2$
    - Quantity imported with free trade=$QD_1-QS_1$
    - Quantity imported with protection=$QD_2-QS_2$
    - Gains of Government with Tariffs revenue/Quota Rent=$(P_{protection}-P_{world})*(QD_2-QS_2)$
    - Gain in Producer Surplus=$(P_{protection}-P_{world})*(QS_1+QS_2)*\frac{1}{2}$
      - in graph, it represents the area left of DS between $P_{world}$ and $P_{protection}$ to the vertical axis
    - Deadweight Loss=$(QS_2-QS_1)*(P_{protection}-P_{world})*\frac{1}{2}+(QD_1-QD_2)*(P_{protection}-P_{world})*\frac{1}{2}$
      - in graph, it represents the *two remaining triangles* after counting the tariffs revenue/quota rents
      - loss welfare of imposing tariffs or quota
    - Loss of `consumer` surplus *partially offset* by domestic `producer` surplus & collection of tariffs revenue by `government`.
  - Voluntary Export Restraints(VER)
    - For importing countries, it can protect domestic producers.
    - welfare loss of importing country=quota without import licenses charged by government
  - Export Subsidies
    - In exporting countries, benefit to producers of exported goods, prices↑, consumers surplus↓
    - $\Delta P↑$=$P_{world}+Subsidiary$
    - Large export of goods→$P_{world}$↓, foreign customers benefit, foreign producers negatively affected.
  - Common Effects:
    - imports↓
    - Price↑
    - Consumer Surplus↓
    - Domestic Supply↓
    - Producer Surplus↑

### 2) Trading blocs/Regional Trading Agreement, Common Markets, Economic Unions

- Types of Agreements to Reduce Trade Barriers
  - Free Trade Area
    - eg: NAFTA
    1. all barriers are removed among members for export and import
  - Customs Union
    1.  2. all members adopt a common trade restrictions with non-members.
  - Common Market
    1. 2. 3. barriers to *capital goods and labors movement* of member countries are removed.
  - Economic Union
    - eg: EU
    1.  2.  3.  4. established <u>common institutions and economic policy</u> for union
  - Monetary Union
    - eg: euro zone
    1. 2. 3. 4. 5. members adopt a single currency

### 3) Objectives of Capital Restrictions

- Definition of Capital Restrictions
  - effects on flow of financial capital across borders
  - Content:
    - prohibition of foreigners invest in domestic country
    - tax or prohibition of income earned on foreign investments by domestic citizens
    - prohibit the *foreign investment* in specific domestic industries
    - restrictions on flow out the earnings of foreign entities operating in domestic
- Effect of Capital Restrictions
  - economic welfare↓
  - avoid impacts of great inflow of foreign capital during expansion and outflow during market unease
- Objectives
  - Reduce volatility of domestic asset prices
    - if larger capital outflow during economics crisis, asset prices ↓
  - Maintain fixed exchange rates
    - some countries have fixed exchange rate target, by *restricting outflow* of investment capital
  - Keep domestic interests rates low
    - by *restricting outflow* of investment capital
  - Protect strategic industries
    - for national security, prevent foreign investment(inflow)
    - eg: telecommunication, defense industries

### 4) Balance and Components of Payment Accounts

- Current Account(flow of goods and services)
  - Types
    - Merchandise and Services
      - Merchandise: raw materials, manufactured goods
      - services: also include fees from patents and copyrights on new technology, software, books
    - Income Receipts:
      - foreign income from dividend of stocks
      - interest on debt securities
    - Unilateral Transfer
      - one-way transfer of assets
        - eg: donor nation国家捐助, money receipts from working abroad and direct foreign aid.
  - ❗️Current account deficit(surplus): net export<0(>0), net **surplus**(deficit) in **capital account** to be balanced.
- Capital Account
  - Capital Transfer
    - debt forgiveness
    - migrant's goods and financial assets
    - transfer title of fixed assets
    - transfer funds related to buy/sell of fixed assets, gifts or inheritance taxes, death duties, uninsured damage to fixed assets

    - foreign official assets and other foreign assets in domestic 
    - domestic government or corporate securities
    - direct investment in domestic country
    - domestic country currency
    - domestic liability to foreigners 

### 5) Effects of Consumer/Firm/Government Decision Making on Payment Balance

- reflect in current account deficit or surplus
- ❗️Relationship Formula: X-M=private savings+government savings-investment in domestic capital
  - if current account deficit is caused buy high investment, future productive power↑
  - if current account deficit is caused by high consumptions(low savings), domestic liability↑ without any future productive power
