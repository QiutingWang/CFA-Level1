# Reading 15 Currency Exchange Rate

## 1. Foreign Exchange Rates

### 1) Exchange Rates

- Definition of Exchange Rate:
  - price or costs of one unit of currency in terms of another
    - Base currency: currency in numerator分子
    - price currency: currency in denominator分母
  - Direct quote: an investor in price currency country
  - Indirect quote: an investor in base currency country
  - Nominal exchange rate: 
    - Definition: the exchange rate <u>at a point in time</u> 
    - if it ↑, purchasing power of price currency ↓, the cost of a unit of base currency in terms of price currency ↑, real exchange rate ↑
  - Real exchange rate
    - Definition: purchasing power of one currency in terms of <u>the amount of goods priced in another currency</u>, related to the base period.
    - represent the *prices level* of two countries
    - if price level in base currency's country ↑ related to the price level in price currency's country, real exchange rate ↑, purchasing power of price currency ↓.
    - End period P/B exchange rate calculation:
      - $real=nominal* \frac{CPI_b}{CPI_p}$
  - Spot exchange rate: 
    - for *immediate* delivery, take place *2 days after the trade*.
  - Forward exchange rate
    - the exchange rate to be done in the *future*
    - quoted for varies future dates(30d, 60d, 90d, 1yr)
    - An agreement with a <u>fixed and pre-defined future trade exchange rate</u>.

### 2) Percentage Change in a Currency Relative to Another

- percentage of price currency appreciated($X\%$)  $!=$ percentage base currency depreciated($Y\%$)
- Calculation: 
  - the percentage change of *base currency* in a foreign exchange quotation 将本国的放分母
  - Sometimes we need to change the unit from $currencyA/currencyB$ to $currencyB/currencyA$

### 3) Functions and Participants in Foreign Exchange Market

- Foreign currency market: 
  - can purchase or sell *foreign goods and service* denominated in *foreign currencies*.
    - sometimes includes <u>foreign capital flows</u>: use foreign currency to buy <u>foreign physical assets</u> and <u>foreign financial securities</u>.
- Foreign exchange rates:
  - arose by cross-border transactions
  - Solution: **forward currency exchange (FX) contact**, fixed exchange rate with a pre-defined amount  
  - Make effort to reduce currency risk→**Hedging** the risk
  - Make effort to increase currency risk→**Speculative**投机的 transaction
- Seller: banks
- Buyers
  - Corporations
    - buy/sell foreign currencies
    - enter into FX forward contracts to hedge risk
  - Investment Accounts
    - Real money accounts
      - mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, other institutional accounts *without derivatives*
    - Leveraged accounts
      - *with* derivatives, hedge funds
  - Governments
    - Component: 
      - sovereign wealth funds
      - pension funds
    - Goals: 
      - transaction, investment, speculation
      - affect *exchange rates* in short term with government policies
  - Retail Market: FX with households or small institutions
  
### 4) Currency Cross-Rates

- Definition: 
  - exchange rate between *2 currencies* implied by exchange rates with a common <u>third currency</u>用第三方货币做媒介来衡量比较2国货币的价格
  - usually the third currency we choose $USD$ or $EUR$
- Calculation logic: 
  - Method1 Multiplication: $A/USD$ * $USD/B$ → $A/B$
  - Method2 Division: $A/USD$ ÷ $B/USD$ → $A/B$
- Necessity: when there is **no** FX market between 2 currencies.

## 2. Forward Exchange Rates

### 1) Outright Forward Quotation Calculation

- Calculation: 
  - Forward exchange rate quote=|spot exchange rate-forward exchange rate|
- Expression
  - Percents: <u>the last decimal place</u> in spot rate quote
  - Points: $±X$ points for a 90-day forward exchange rate means that forward rate is $X*10^{-a}$ more/less than spot exchange rate. 
    - $a$: the same as the points' 小数点后的位数

### 2) Arbitrage Relationship between Spot Rates, Forward Rates, Interest Rates

- With *free trade* and *forward currency contracts*, forward exchange rate=difference of two countries *interest rate*
  - Formula Expression:Interest Rate Parity $\frac{forwardRate}{spotRate}=\frac{1+interestRate_{priceCurrency}}{1+interestRate_{baseCurrency}}$
  - 🌟if the relationship doesn't hold, <u>arbitrage trade</u> exists.
  - arbitrage trade: there is an opportunity to <u>make profit without risk</u>.

### 3) Forward Discount/Premium Calculation

- Definition:
  - the difference between *forward price* & *spot price* for *the base currency*
  - Formula: $Forward \space Discount \space or \space Premium=\frac{ForwardRate}{SpotRate}-1$
    - if difference>0, forward rate > discount rate, forward premium
    - if difference<0, forward rate < discount rate, forward discount
  - Annualized forward discount or premium by <u>multiplying 1yr/forward_period</u>

### 4) Calculate Forward Rate Consistent with Spot Rate and Interest Rate

- Formula: $Forward \space Rate=SpotRate*(\frac{1+I_{priceCurrency}}{1+I_{baseCurrency}})$
  - **Notes**: the period of interest rate==the period of forward rate. 注意期限相同。但在市场上同一的表述方法是年化，所以在<1yr时间段内使用的时候，要从年化率转为specific的short term rates.
  - it is an arbitrage-free forward rate

## 3. Managing Exchange Rates

### 1) Exchange Rate Regimes

- Types:
  - Countries do not have their own currency and domestic currency policies
    - they use currency of another country, **format dollarization**
    - they are member of a **monetary union**, which several countries use a common currency.
      - eg: EU
  - Countries have their own currency 
    - Currency Broad Arrangement
      - Definition: exchange domestic currency for a specified foreign currency at a <u>fixed exchange rate</u>
      - eg: <u>HK Monetary Authority</u> earns interests on <u>US dollars</u>
        - the authority gives up the ability to conduct independent monetary policy.
        - imports <u>inflation rates</u> from outside currency
    - Conventional Fixed Peg Arrangement挂钩🪝
      - Definition: 
        - peg currency within *±1% margin* VS <u>another currency</u> or VS a <u>basket</u> including major trading or financial partners
      - Monetary Authority:
        - Direct intervention:
          - maintain <u>exchange rates</u> within a **band** by buying/selling foreign currencies in FX market.
        - Indirect intervention:
          - change interest rates policy
          - regulation of FX transactions
          - convince people to constrain foreign exchange activity 
    - Target Zone
      - Definition: permitted fluctuation in currency value in relative to another currency or baskets of currency are **wider(±2%)**
      - Monetary Authority:
        - 应该更谨慎, because bands are wider.
    - Crawling Peg爬行钉住汇率制
      - Definition: 
        - exchange rate adjusted periodically
        - passive crawling peg
          - to adjust for a <u>higher inflation</u> VS the pegged currency
          - Effects: avoid the threat of devaluation
        - active crawling peg
          - the exchange rate adjustments are <u>announced or implemented</u>.
          - Effects: influence expectations, add some predictability to domestic inflation
      - Monetary Authority: <u>more restricted</u> than a fixed peg arrangement
    - Management of Exchange Rates within Crawling Bands
      - Definition: the width of bands is *increased* over time.
      - Effect: <u>fixed peg</u>→<u>floating rate</u>, when monetary authority *lack of credibility*, making an immediate change to floating rate impractical.
      - Monetary Authority: more flexibility
    - Managed Floating Exchange Rate
      - Definition: 
        - influence exchange rate in response to *specific indicators*, such as payments balances, inflation rates, employment
      - Monetary Authority: intervention directly or indirectly
      - Effects: induce trading partners, the stability ↓ 
    - Independently Floating
      - Definition: market determined exchange rates
      - Monetary Authority:
        - interventions only can <u>slow the rate of change</u> and <u>reduce short-term fluctuations</u>

### 2) Effects of Exchange Rates on International Trade and Capital Flows

- Formula to Express Relationship between <u>Capital Flows and Balance of Trade</u>:
  - $X-M=(S-I)+(T-G)$
    - $S$: private savings
    - $I$: investment in physical capital
    - $T$: tax revenue
    - $G$: government spending
    - $X$: export
    - $M$: import
  - Intuition: 
    - if $X-M<0$, total savings < domestic investment, the *surplus* in *capital account* to offset *deficit* in *trade account.*
- Elasticities Approach
  - Definition: 
    - how exchange rate impacts <u>total value of import and export</u>注意这里不是quantity所以要涉及到弹性，即价格和数量之间的关系
  - Cases:
    - *Depreciation* of domestic currency, import more expensive, exports less expensive, $X-M>0$, trade deficit↓.
  - Marshall-Lerner Condition:
    - $W_X\epsilon_X+W_M(\epsilon_M-1)>0$
      - $W_X$: export proportion in total trade
      - $W_M$: import proportion
        - if import expenditure=export revenue $W_X=W_M$→$\epsilon_X+\epsilon_M>1$
      - $\epsilon_X$: absolute value of price elasticity of export demand
      - $\epsilon_M$: absolute value of price elasticity of import demand
    - Intuition: the compositions of exports/imports goods are important
      - goods with <u>close substitutions</u>, luxury goods, or consumer spending消费品奢饰品, elasticity of demand ↑
      - goods with few substitutions, necessities, elasticity of demand ↓
  - J-Curve
    - <u>import and export quantities</u> are relatively insensitive to *currency depreciation* in short run.
    - ❗️initially, currency depreciation--> trade deficit↑(worsen) in a short period.
    - Then importers adjust by <u>reducing quantities</u>.
    - Then Marshall-Lerner Condition begins to hold and improves trading account balance, trade deficit ↓
  - Shortcomings:
    - only consider <u>microeconomic relationship</u> between exchange rates and trade balance, and ignore *macroeconomic relationship*
- Absorption Approach
  - Definition: *trade deficit* or *trade surplus* in capital accounts, focusing on capital flows
  - Formula: $BT=Y-E$
    - $Y$: domestic production or national income
    - $E$: domestic absorption or total expenditure
    - $BT$: balance of trade
  - Intuition: currency depreciation has effects depends on current level *economy capacity utilization* 
    - if current economy level < full employment
      - currency depreciation makes *domestic goods and services* more attractive than foreign
    - if current economy level = full employment, total expenditure↑→price level↑, currency depreciation makes savings↑, domestic assets value↓
