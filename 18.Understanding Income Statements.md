        - Determinate Factor: whether the goods and service are provided *distinct* from already transferred or not.
  - Identify distinct or separate `performance obligation` in contract
    - a promise to deliver a **distinct** good or service
      - distinct criteria:
        - customers can <u>get benefit</u> from good or service有利可获
        - this promise can be <u>identified separately</u> from other promises有区分度
  - Determine *transaction prices*
    - usually a fixed amount, but in some cases it is a variable because of a bonus for early delivery(performance bonus与业绩按比例挂钩一部分)

  - **Recognize revenue** when entity satisfies a performance obligation
    - for a *long-term contracts*, the <u>progress</u> of a company to <u>complete performance obligation</u> is the essential element of revenue recognition. [Percentage-of-Completion Method]
      - the process can be measured from *input side*(% of completion cost incurred) and *output side*(% of total output delivered to date)
      - cost to secure long-term contract(eg: sales commission), must be <u>capitalized</u>
    - *Revenue* can be recognized when it is <u>highly probably</u> they have to reserve it.退货
