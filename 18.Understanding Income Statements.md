# Reading 18 Understanding Income Statements

## 1. Income Statement Overview

### Components and Alternative Presentation Format

- Equation Logic: $Net Income=Revenue - Expense$
  - Full equation: $Net Income=Revenues-Ordinary \space Expenses-Other \space Income-Other \space Expense+Gains-Losses$
- Goals of Preparing Income Statement:
  - valuation
  - investors need to know information about ability to make promised interest and principle payments
- Component:
  - Revenue
    - $net \space revenue= sales \space of \space goods \space and \space service - estimated \space returns \space adjustment - allowance$
    - in some countries, revenue is called *turnover*.
  - Expense
    - Definition: amounts incurred to generate revenue
    - Components:
      - Cost of goods sold, operating expense, interest, taxes, depreciation expense
    - Classification
      - by function: eg cost of goods sold: include 
      - by nature
  - Gains and Losses
    - 不一定来源于ordinary business activity
    - eg: Sales of surplus PPE, the differences between book value and sales price
  - Controlling interests & Non-controlling interests(minority interest or minority owners' interests) in subsidiary and consolidation statement.
    - NCI is excluded from consolidation statement and comes to <u>net income</u> of parent company.
- Presentation Format
  - Single Step: all revenue grouped & all expenses grouped
  - Multi Step: [Formation]
    - Revenue
    - -Cost of Goods Sold
      - Gross Profit
    - -Selling, General, and Administration Expense
    - -Depreciation Expense
      - Operating Profit

      - Income before Taxes
    - -Taxes Expenses
      - Income from Continuous Operations
    - Earnings or Losses from Discountinuous Operations
      - Net Income(also called *earnings/bottom line*)

## 2. Revenue Recognition

### 1) General Principles

- When? 
  - Revenue is recognized at the time of goods and cash/returns <u>exchange</u>
  - Not depend on cash payment and receipt
  - as the goods are transferred to the buyer
  - on credit related accounts: unearned revenue (liability), or account receivable(asset)

### 2) Accounting Standards

- IRFS & GAAP: principle based approach
  - Central principle: accrual责任制
- Five Process of Revenue Recognition
  - Identify contract
    - Contract Revisions
      - decide whether revenue recognition regarded as an <u>extension of original contract</u> or a <u>new contract</u>
        - Determinate Factor: whether the goods and service are provided *distinct* from already transferred or not.
  - Identify distinct or separate `performance obligation` in contract
    - a promise to deliver a **distinct** good or service
      - distinct criteria:
        - customers can <u>get benefit</u> from good or service有利可获
        - this promise can be <u>identified separately</u> from other promises有区分度
  - Determine *transaction prices*
    - usually a fixed amount, but in some cases it is a variable because of a bonus for early delivery(performance bonus与业绩按比例挂钩一部分)
    - Acting as an Agent, 收中介费commission佣金
  - Allocate transaction prices to performance obligations in contract
  - **Recognize revenue** when entity satisfies a performance obligation
    - for a *long-term contracts*, the <u>progress</u> of a company to <u>complete performance obligation</u> is the essential element of revenue recognition. [Percentage-of-Completion Method]
      - the process can be measured from *input side*(% of completion cost incurred) and *output side*(% of total output delivered to date)
      - cost to secure long-term contract(eg: sales commission), must be <u>capitalized</u>
    - *Revenue* can be recognized when it is <u>highly probably</u> they have to reserve it.退货
      - if not, company should <u>recognize a liability</u> for a refund obligation. At the same time, record a offsetting *asset* for returned goods.

## 3. Expense Recognition

### 1) General Principle, Application of Expense Recognition, and Implication of Financial Analysis Expense Recognition Choices

- Choices:
  - Cash basis
  - Accrual basis: matching principle
    - expense recognition timing is the same as the period of its associated generated revenues 
    - Period Costs: 
      - eg: administration costs
      - *not* all expenses are *directly tied* with revenue generation
- Inventory Expense Recognition
  - Specific identification
    - Definition: the company identifies which items were sold and which remain with identification number
  - FIFO
    - suitable for inventories with limited shelf time
  - LIFO
    - suitable for inventories without deteriorating退坏 with age
    - It is popular because of <u>income tax benefits</u> in US.
    - Only allowed in US GAAP, not allowed in IFRS.
  - Weighted Average Costs
    - makes no assumption about the order
    - popular cuz of easy to use
    - use Average Cost=total cost of available/total unit available
- Deprecation Expense
  - allocation cost of long-term assets: depreciation, depletion(natural resources), amortization
  - Straight-line depreciation
    - recognize <u>equal amount of depreciation expense</u> per period
    - formula: $SL \space Depreciation \space Expense=\frac{Cost-Residual \space Value}{Useful \space Life}$
  - Accelerated depreciation
    - owing to most of long-term assets *generate more benefits in early years*, while fewer benefits generated in later year of their economic life.
    - total depreciation expense of this method == total DE that of straight line method
  - Declining/Diminishing Balance Method(DB)
    - apply a <u>constant rate</u> of depreciation to *book value* of assets each year
    - Most common used method: Double-Declining Balance(DBB)
      - two times straight-line rate
- Amortization Expense
  - applied in cost allocation of intangible asset
    - Exception: intangible asset with *infinite lives* are not amortized. While, an <u>impairment test</u> manually is required.
- Bad Debt & Warranty Expense
  - if sell on credit or provide a warranty to customer-->bad debt/warranty expenses estimated
- Implication
  - Delay expense recognition→current net income↑→more aggressive
  - Analyst should compare firms' estimation to other companies in the same industry
    - Decide whether lower warranty owing to <u>higher product quality</u> or <u>aggressive estimation</u>
  - accounting policies and significant estimations should be shown in:
    - FS footnotes
    - management discussion and analysis(MD&A)
  
### 2) Non-recurring Items Analysis & Accounting Policies Changes

- Non-Recurring Items
  - Discontinued operations
    - Definition:
      - decide to dispose but haven't to do so, or has disposal of in the current year after generated income or loss
      - the performance of asset, operations, investing, and financing activities are distinct from the rest of firm.
    - Measurement date: 
      - the day company develops a disposing of an operation plan
      - state the estimation of *phaseout period's and business sales' losses*
      - <u>expected gain on disposal</u> will not been reported until *sales are completed*.
    - Phaseout period: the time different between measurement period and actual disposal date.
    - Reporting position: separately in income statement, below income from continuing operations, net of tax
    - Analysts will **not consider** the discontinued operations when <u>forecasting future earnings</u>.
  - Unusual or infrequent items
    - eg: impairments, write-offs(write the value of asset==0), write-downs(partial devaluation, report the value of asset< original value), restructuring costs, gain/loss from sales of assets or activities which are not ordinary operations of firms
    - Definition: unusual in nature or infrequent 
    - Reporting position: income from continuing operations before tax
    - Implications: analyst want to review and check whether these items truly included in future performance forecasting
- Accounting Policies and Estimates Changes
  - Accounting changes types
    - accounting policies change
      - *retrospective* application is required
    - accounting estimation change
      - Reasons:
        - management judgement changes
        - new information
      - *prospective* application is required
      - do not affect cash flow
    - prior-period adjustments change
      - Definition: a correction of an prior FS accounting errors
      - *retrospective* application is required
      - its <u>effect on net income</u> and *significant adjustment disclosure* is required
      - cash flow haven't been affected
      - Implications: errors may indicate weaknesses in firm <u>internal control</u>
  - Two Kinds of Applications
    - retrospective application:
      - pervious period FS restate in current FS
      - apply new policies on these and future statements
      - it enhances comparability
      - *modified retrospective application*: 
        - prior-period FS are not restated
        - <u>beginning period</u> of related accounts are adjusted for the *cumulative amount* of change
    - prospective application: 
      - new policies are applied only on <u>future statements</u>
      - prior FS not been restated.

### 3) Operating VS Non-operating Components

- These two accounts are reported separately in income statement
- For non-financial firm, non-operating income comes from 
  - investment income or financing expenses
    - include: interests expense, gain/loss from securities sales, receive *dividend* and interest from other firm
- For financial firm, investment income or financing expenses are considered as <u>operating income</u>

## 4. EPS and Dilutive Securities

### 1) EPS Calculation and Interpretation

- EPS:
  - profitability measures of *public* traded firm
  - only reported for <u>common stock</u>
- Capital Structure:
  - Simple
    - without potentially dilutive securities
    - component: common stock, nonconvertible debt, nonconvertible preferred stock
    - firms with simple capital structure, only *basic EPS* reporting is required
  - Complex
    - contains potentially dilutive securities
    - eg: options, warrants, convertible securities
    - firms with complex capital structures must report *basic & diluted EPS*
- Basic EPS
  - Calculation: $BasicEPS=\frac{Net \space Income-Preferred \space Dividends}{WeightedAvg \space No. \space of \space Outstanding \space Common \space Shares}$
    - Numerator: income available to common stockholders
    - Issues when computing denominator:
      - <u>reacquired shares</u> are excluded from computation
      - weighting average is calculated by *outstanding period/length of time in a fiscal year*
        - monthly method (X/12) is used in exam usually.
      - *share insurance date* is the starting point included in weighting system
      - share dividend or stock splits are applied to all *shares outstanding* <u>prior</u> to split or dividend and *beginning period's* weighted average shares.
- Effect of Stock Dividends and Stock Splits
  - Stock dividend
    - the distribution of *additional shares* to each shareholder im amount of *proportional* to their current number of shares
    - 10% shock dividend paid: the holder of 100 shares will receive 10 additional common stock
  - Stock splits
    - Division of each 'old' share into a specific number of 'new' shares
    - 2-for-1 split: 100→200
  - the <u>proportion</u> of shareholders' ownership of the company **unchanged**

### 2) Dilutive VS Anti-dilutive Securities
  
- Diluted securities: will decrease EPS if executed
- Anti-diluted securities: will increase EPS if executed and converted to common stock
- Diluted EPS
  - ❗️Equation: $DilutedEPS=\frac{Net \space Income-Preferred \space Dividend+Dividend \space on \space Convertible \space Preferred \space Stock+After-tax \space Interest \space on \space Convertible \space Debt}{WeightedAvg \space Shares+Shares \space from \space Conversion \space of \space Convertible \space Preferred \space Shares+Shares \space from \space Conversion \space of \space Convertible \space Debt+Shares \space Issuable \space from \space Stock \space Options/Warrants}$
  - each potentially dilutive security must consider independently.
  - Quick way to decide whether the convertible preferred stock/convertible debt is diluted or anti-diluted:
    - $\frac{Convertible \space Debt \space Interest*(1-t)}{Convertible \space Debt \space Shares} VS. \space BasicEPS$
    - $\frac{Convertible \space Preferred \space Shares \space Dividend}{Convertible \space Preferred \space Shares} VS. \space BasicEPS$
  - **Treasury Stock Method**
    - used for dilutive stock options & warrants, whose exercise price < average stock market price
    - to calculate # of shares in denominator
    - Assumption: 
      - funds received from options exercise by company would be used to purchase firms' *common stocks* in the market *at average market price*
      - 🌟Net increase in # of outstanding shares=numbers of shares created by option exercising-numbers of shares repurchased
      - Quick calculation of net increase amount:
        - $\frac{AMP-EP}{AMP}*N$
          - $AMP$: average market price over year
          - $EP$: exercise price of option or warrants
          - $N$: # of converted common shares from options or warrants exercising

## 5. Common-size Income Statements

### 1) Formulate Income Statements to Common-size Income Statement

- Presented as <u>a percentage of sales revenue</u>, eliminating the effects of size
- useful for *time-series* analysis and *cross-section* analysis comparison
- used to examine firms' strategy
- While, tax expense expressed by percentage of *sales revenue* is not informative. 
  - Instead, percentage of *pretax income* is preferred.-->Effective Tax Rate

### 2) Evaluating Firms' Performance using Common-size IS and Financial Ratios used by IS

- Gross profit margin=$\frac{Gross \space Profit}{Revenue}$
  - increase price due to brands name, quality, technology, patent protection, or reduce production costs→Gross profit margin↑
- Net profit margin=$\frac{Net Income}{Revenue}$
  - profit generated after considering all expenses
- Other useful margin: subtotal expressed by percentage of revenue
  - operating profit margin
  - pretax margin

### 3) Calculate & Interpret Comprehensive Income and Describe Other Comprehensive Income Components

- Comprehensive income:
  - include all changes in equity except for <u>owner contributions and distributions</u>
  - CI=Net Income + Other Comprehensive Income
    - Dividend/Interest receive-->Income statement
    - OCI Components
      - foreign currency translation gains/losses
      - Minimum pension liability adjustment
      - Cash flow hedging derivatives unrealized gain/loss
      - Available-for-sale securities unrealized gain/loss
        - unrealized gain/loss:
          - firm owns but has bnt yet sold
- US GAAP
  - Trading securities: 
    - debt that a firm owns but intends to sell
    - unrealized gain/loss→income statement
  - Held to Maturity
    - debt not intends to sell prior to maturity
    - unrealized gains/loss not reported in Income Statement or OCI
    - it is classified on <u>balance sheet</u>
  - Available-for-Sale
    - debt not expected to be hold to maturity or sold in near term
    - unrealized gains/losses reported on OCI not in income statement
- IFRS
  - 3 Value Measurement Methods
    - at fair value through profit or loss<->trading securities in GAAP
    - at amortized cost<->held-to-maturity in GAAP
    - at fair value through other comprehensive income<->available for sale in GAAP
