# Reading 19 Understanding Balance Sheets

## 1. Balance Sheet Introduction

- Elements
  - Assets, Liability, Equity

## 2. Assets & Liabilities

### 1) Uses and Limitations of Balance Sheet in Financial Analysis

- Usage:
  - access to firms' liquidity, solvency偿付, and ability to make distribution to shareholders
    - liquidity: meet short-term obligations
    - Solvency: meet long-term obligations
- Limitations:
  - many valuation basis, mix together
    - market value, fair value, intrinsic value, historical cost, amortized cost
  - some assets and liabilities *do not appear* in the BS.
  - the value of *employees and reputation* are not reported

### 2) Alternative Formats of BS Presentation

- Classified balance sheet: 
  - separate current and noncurrent items
  - Both effective for IFRS and GAAP
- Liquidity-based format:
  - mostly used in banking industry
  - present assets and liabilities in order of *liquidity*
  - under IFRS

## 3. Current Assets & Liabilities

### 1) Current/Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities

- Current asset
  - definition: cash or can convert into cash or use up within 1 year or 1 operating period
  - usually presented in order of liquidity
  - reveal the information of <u>operating activities</u> of company.
- Current liabilities
  - trading purpose
  - settlement expected within normal operating cycle or one year
  - not an unconditional right to defer settlement for >1 year
- Working capital=current asset-current liability
  - too small: liquidity problem
  - too large: inefficient use of assets
- Noncurrent assets
  - provide information about <u>investing activities</u>
- Noncurrent liability
  - provide information about <u>long-term financing activities</u>

### 2) Different Types of A&L and Measurement Basis

- Current Assets 
  - Cash and cash equivalents
    - short term, high liquidity
    - near enough to maturity
    - interest rate risk is insignificant
    - eg of cash equivalents: treasury bill, commercial paper, money market funds
    - treated as financial assets
    - valuation methods: amortized cost or fair value
      - either comes to the same value
  - Marketable securities
    - traded in public market, values are readily determined
    - eg: Treasury bills, notes, bonds, equity securities
    - details disclosed in financial footnotes
  - Account/trade receivable
    - measurement: reported at <u>net realizable value</u>, based on estimated <u>bad debt expenses</u>, which increase the *allowance for doubtful accounts*(contra-asset account)
    - AR at net realizable value=gross receivables-allowance for doubtful accounts
    - if AR are *written-off*(removed from balance sheet because of noncollectible), gross receivables and allowance↓
    - sales receivable reveals <u>collection problems</u>
    - allowance for doubtful accounts reveal *level and growth rate of sales*
  - Inventories
    - classification of manufacturing companies:
      - raw material, work-in-process, finish goods
    - related costs classification:
      - purchase cost, conversion cost, other cost necessary to bring inventories present location and condition
    - Standard costing & retail method(measure inventory cost)
      - standard costing: assign pre-set amount of materials, labors, and overhead to goods produced
      - retail methods: retail price-gross profit=to determine cost
    - FIFO, LIFO, Average cost
    - Inventory Reporting
      - IFRS: at the lower of cost and net realizable value
        - **net realizable value**=selling price-completion cost-disposal costs
      - GAAP: inventory cost method(LIFO or retail method), market=replacement cost
      - if net realizable value(IFRS) or market(GAAP) < inventory carrying value→inventory written down, loss recognized in IS
      - if there is subsequent value recovery:
        - IFRS, written back up
        - GAAP, no written back, but firms can report *greater profit* when selling inventories.
      - higher inventory: indication of inventory obsolescence库存淘汰
  - Other current assets
    - cannot be material if shown separately, hence they should be <u>combined into one single account</u>
    - eg: prepaid expenses(as Asset)
- Current Liabilities
  - Account/Trade payable
    - related to purchase as a signal credit problems with suppliers
  - Unearned/deferred revenue/income:
    - Definition: cash collected before providing goods and services
    - an indicator of future growth
  - Accrued Liabilities
    - eg: tax payable, interest payable, wages payable, accrued warranty expense
    - Definition: expenses recognized in income statement but not yet contractually due.
  - Note payable & current portion of long-term debt
    - if maturities >1 year-->noncurrent liabilities

## 4. Noncurrent Assets & Liabilities

- Property, plant, and equipment(PPE)
  - content: natural resource, land and buildings, machinery and equipment, furniture
  - Reporting methods
    - IFRS: Cost method, revaluation method
    - GAAP: cost method
      - Amortized cost:
        - historical cost-accumulated depreciation-amortization-depletion-impairment losses
          - historical cost=purchase price+necessary cost to get asset ready for use(eg: delivery and installation costs)
          - others value depends on <u>depreciation methods and useful life, salvage value estimations</u>.
          - impairment test:
            - whether carrying value>recoverable amount
            - IFRS: recoverable amount= max(fair value-selling cost, value in use)
              - value in use=PV(asset future cash flow stream)
            - Loss recovery is allowed under IFRS, but not under GAAP
      - Revaluation model:
        - PPE reporting amount=fair value-accumulated depreciation
- Investment property
  - Definition: assets generate rental income or capital appreciation(Under IFRS)
  - reporting method: at *amortized cost* or *fair value*
    - fair value method: report on income statement
- Deferred tax assets
  - reasons
    - differences between financial reporting income & tax reporting income
      - expenses or losses recognized in income statement *before* they are tax deductible.
      - revenue or gains are taxable before income statement recognition
  - deferred tax assets creation:
    - =taxes payable - income tax expense in income statement
    - unused tax losses from prior periods(不太理解)

## 5. Intangible Assets

- Definition:
  - non-monetary assets lack physical substance
- Types:
  - Identifiable
    - eg: patents, trademarks, copyrights
    - Definition: can be acquired separately, a kind of rights or privilege
    - Reporting: purchasing can be written on Balance sheet with cost or revaluation methods
      - Under GAAP, only cost model is allowed.
  - Unidentifiable
    - Definition: cannot be acquired separately, have unlimited useful life
    - eg: goodwill
      - Definition: purchase price-fair value of identifiable net asset in business acquisition
        - if goodwill<0, gain of bargain 
      - reasons: 
        - some assets are not disclosure on financial statements but unquantifiable.
          - eg: customer loyalty, brand reputation
        - reflect perceived synergies协同效应 from combination
          - eg: eliminate duplicate facilities, reduce payroll
      - not amortized, but pass impairment test annually
- Created internally, except for legal costs
  - eg: research and development costs
    - GAAP: treated as expenses
    - IFRS: <u>capitalize</u> cost incurring in *development* stage. Expenses the cost incurred in research stage.
- With limited useful life
  - amortized over useful life
  - impairment test
  - revealed at least annually
- With infinite useful life
  - not amortize
  - pass impairment test at least annually
- **Expensed** items listed under IFRS and GAAP:
  - start-up and training costs
  - administrative overhead
  - ads and promotion costs
  - relocation and reorganization cost
  - Termination costs

## 6. Marketable Securities

- Held-to-maturity securities
- Trading securities
- Available for sale securities

## 7. Shareholders' Equity and Ratios

### 1) Components of Equity

- Contributed(Issued) Capital
  - the amount contributed by shareholders
  - par value(share capital)
    - some common stocks are issued without par value
  - share premium: additional paid-in capital
  - amount of Authorized(under firms' article)/Issued/Outstanding shares(issued-repurchase amount)
- Preferred Stock
  - have some rights or privilege not conferred by common stock
    - eg: preferred stockholders are paid dividend at certain rate, or <u>have priority over</u> common stockholders in event of *liquidation*
  - Classification:
    - non-redeemable: equity
    - mandatory redemption in fixed amount: financial liability
- Treasury stock
  - stocks have been reacquired by issuing firm
  - it reduces shareholder's equity
  - It isn't an investment activity of firm
  - no voting rights, receive no dividend
- Retained Earning:
  - undistributed earnings(net income)
  - the accumulative earnings *haven't* paid for dividends
- Non-controlling interest(NCI)
  - Definition: minority shareholder share of net asset of a subsidiary which is not wholly owned by parent
- Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income(AOCI)
  - not include net income and transactions with shareholders

### 2) Statement of Changes in Shareholder's Equity

- Columns:
  - Common stock
  - Retained earnings
  - AOCI
  - Total
- Rows:
  - Beginning balance
  - Net income
  - Other Comprehensive Income
    - Net unrealizable gain/loss on available for sales securities
    - Net unrealizable gain/loss on cash flow hedging derivatives
    - Foreign currency translation
    - Adjustment of minimum pension liability
  - Comprehensive income
  - Issuance of Common stock
  - Repurchase of Common stock
  - Dividend
  - Ending balance

### 3) Common-size Balance Sheet

- Presentation method: as percentage of *total assets*
- standardize balance sheet by eliminating the effect of size
- allow for time-series and cross-section analysis comparison
- used for examine firms's strategies

### 3) Liquidity and Solvency Ratios

- Liquidity ratios: measure firms' ability to satisfy <u>short-term obligation</u> as coming due
  - current ratio=current assets/current liabilities
  - quick ratio(or acid-test ratio)=(cash+marketable securities+receivables)/current liabilities
    - except *inventory* account
  - cash ratio=(cash+marketable securities)/current liabilities
    - except inventory and receivables
- Solvency ratios: measures ability to satisfy long-term obligation
  - long-term debt-to-equity=long-term debt/total equity
  - total debt-to-equity=total debt/total equity
  - debt ratio=total debt/total assets
  - financial leverage=total asset/total equity
- Limitations:
  - firms may use different accounting standards and estimates
  - in different industries, comparison lacks of homogeneity
  - ratios interpretation requires <u>significant judgement</u>
  - B/S data only measured at a point of time
