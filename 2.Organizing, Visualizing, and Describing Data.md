## 1. Organizing Data

### Data Type

#### 1. Numerical and Categorical Data

- Numerical data: counted or measured
  - Discrete: countable
  - Continuous: take any fractional value
- Categorical data: labels that can be classify a set of data into groups
  - Nominal: without order
  - Ordinal: can be ranked in order respect to the specific characteristic

#### 2. Time Series and Cross-sectional

- Time Series: observations taken periodically.Êó∂Èó¥ÂèòÔºåÁßçÁ±ª‰∏çÂèò
- Cross-sectional: comparable observations taken at one specific point in time.ÁßçÁ±ªÂèòÔºåÊó∂Èó¥‰∏çÂèò

The two types of data combined together form **panel data**.

#### 3. Structured and Unstructured

### Frequency Distribution

- Define the intervals: the range of values with upper and lower limits, all-inclusive, non-overlapping, numbers of interval
- TallyÔºà‰∏ÄËá¥,Ê†áÁ≠æÔºâ the observations:observations should be assigned to their appropriate interval
- Count:

  - **absolute frequency**: actual number of observations

    - Mode frequency: the interval with greatest frequency
  - **relative frequency**: divide the absolute frequency of each return interval by the total number of observations (%)
  - **Cumulative absolute frequency** and **Cumulative relative frequency** can be calculated
  - cumulative relative frequency of a bin identifies the fraction of observations that **are less than the upper limit of the given bin**

### Contingency Table

- 2-dimensional array, analyzing 2 variables as the same time, using nominal or ordinal data, with a finite number attributes
- **Joint frequency**: each cell shows the frequency which is related to two attributes simultaneously
- **Marginal frequency**: total frequency for the row or a column
- **Confusion Matrix**: one kind of contingency table with numbers of occurrences predicted and actually observed

## 2. Visualizing Data

### Graph Type

- Histogram:
  - absolute frequency distribution
  - See where most of the observations are concentrated
  - a bar chart of continuous data
- Frequency polygon
- Cumulative (absolute/relative) frequency distribution chart
- Bar chart: illustrate **relative** sizes, degrees, or magnitudes
  - grouped bar chart/clustered bar chart: show 2 categories at once
  - stacked bar chart:
    - height of each bar: the cumulative frequency for a category
    - Colors within each bar: joint frequencies
- Tree map: visualizing **relative sizes** of categories with different colors or shades
- Word cloud: visualizing text, counting the uses/frequency of specific words which shows in **type size**
- Line charts: usually used for visualizing **time series** data
  - Multiple time series: when scales of time series are different, use left and right vertical axes
  - Bubble line chart: different sizes bubble represent the relative size of another variable
- Scatter plot: how _2 variables_ tend to change _in relation to_ each other
  - correlation coefficient: a measure of strength of a linear relationship
- Scatter plot matrix: analyze three variables
- Heat map: use color and shades to display data frequency, with data from contingency table

### Choose from Visualization Types

- Relationship,Comparison,Distribution
- avoid from misrepresentation to mislead investors

## 3. Measures of Central Tendency

- identify the center, average to represent the typical or expected value in dataset
- **Arithmetic mean**: `ùù®observation value/#of observations`, estimate the next observation, expected value of distribution
  - Eg:
    - **population mean**: given population only 1 mean
    - **sample mean**: to make inferences about the population mean
  - Properties:
    - all datasets only have one arithmetic mean
    - all data value are considered in arithmetic mean computation
    - all interval and ratio datasets have an arithmetic mean
    - The sum of _deviations_ of each observation in the dataset from mean=0 `ùù®(Xi-X_bar)=0`
  - **Outliers** have an influence in arithmetic mean, providing all-sided information.
    - it should be excluded from measure of central tendency
    - Instead, **trimmed mean** is used (1%= 0.5%lowest + 0.5%highest discarded) without outliers
    - **Winsorized mean**:substitute a value for <5th percentile and >95th percentile, if select 90% Winsor mean. Then calculate the revised dataset. Decrease the effects of outlier.
- **Weighted mean**: different observations have a disproportionate influence on mean.
  - $\sum_i^nW_iX_i$ , where ùù®Wi=1
  - usually used to calculate `<u>`portfolio return `</u>`, the _weight_ of individual asset=market value of each asset/market value of entire portfolio
- **Median**: midpoint with sorted dataset
  - not so affected by extreme values
  - Calculation: with odd/even number of observations
- **Mode**: value occurs most frequently
  - datasets can have >=1 or no mode, Unimodal, Bimodal, Trimodal
- **Geometric Mean**: get investment returns over _multiple periods_, or used to compute _compound_ growth rate.
  - Function:$G=(\prod_iX_i)^{\frac{1}{N}}$
    - the radical sign is non-negative.
  - $1+R_G=\sqrt[n]{\prod(1+R_t)}$, where $R_t$ is the return of period t. Then we can get $R_G$ as the result at final.
  - By financial calculator: [$y^x$][n][$\frac{1}{x}$][=]
  - Geometric Mean ‚â§ Arithmetic Mean.
    - the difference between these two mean ‚Üë, when the dispersion of observation ‚Üë
    - When all observations are equal, arithmetic=geometric mean
- **Harmonic Mean**: used to calculate _average cost of shares_ purchased over time.
  - Function: $\frac{N}{\sum_i^N\frac{1}{X_i}}$
  - after we get average cost per share, if the total money purchase of shares is given, the _total amount of shares purchased_ can be computed.
  - harmonic mean< geometric mean< arithmetic mean

## 4. Measures of Location and Dispersion

### Location: Quantile + Measures of Central Tendency

- **Quantile**: value <= a stated _proportion_ of data with a distribution

  - Type:
    - Quartile: 4
      - $Q3-Q1$: inter-quartile range
    - Quintile: 5
    - Decile: 10
    - Percentile: 100
  - Formula: Position of the observation $L_y=(n+1)\frac{y}{100}$
    - $y$: at a given percentile
    - $n$: data points in ascending order
  - Visualization: Box and whisker plot
    - Box: inter-quartile range
    - Vertical line: entire range with largest/smallest values
- **Dispersion**: variability around the central tendency.

  - in finance, central tendency is reward, dispersion is a measure of risk.
  - **Range**: provide extremely useful information
    - function: $Range=X_{max}-X_{min}$
  - **Mean Absolute Deviation(MAD)**: use average the absolute value of deviation from the mean
    - function: $MAD=\frac{\sum_i^n|X_i-\bar{X}|}{n}$
  - **Sample Variance($s^2$)**: $s^2=\frac{\sum_i^n (X_i-\bar{X})^2}{n-1}$
    - use $n-1$ as denominator: _unbiased estimator_ of population variance
    - **Sample Standard Variance**$s=\sqrt[2]{\frac{\sum_i^n (X_i-\bar{X})^2}{n-1}}$, whose _unit_ is the same as the unit of data.
      - unbiased estimator of population standard deviation $\sigma$.
  - **Relative Dispersion**: the amount of variability in a distribution relative to a benchmark.
    - Quantified as **Coefficient of Variation(CV)**, whose benchmark chosen as _mean_ of distribution.
      - function: $CV=\frac{S_x}{\bar{X}}$
      - The lower the better.
      - In Finance, $CV$ measures the `<u>`risk per unit of expected return `</u>`.
    - Direct `<u>`compare the dispersion `</u>` between different sets of data.
- **Downside Risk**: only include outcomes< mean(or other benchmark)ÂÆûÈôÖÊî∂Áõä‰Ωé‰∫éÈ¢ÑÊúüÁöÑÈ£éÈô©Ôºå‰∏ãË°åÈ£éÈô©

  - Name: **Target Downside Deviation/Semi-deviation**
  - Function: $s_{target}=\sqrt[2]{\frac{\sum_{all \space X_i<B}^n(X_i-B)^2}{n-1}}$, where $B$ is target
    - Be careful that the denominator we use $n-1$

## 5. Skewness, kurtosis, and Correlation

- _Symmetrical_: the degree of symmetry measures if the _deviations from the mean_ are positive or negative.
- Skewness and Kurtosis are critical points for **risk management**.
  - greater positive kurtosis & more negative skewness in return distribution‚Üí **increased** risk
- **Skewness**: show the non-symmetric distribution with positive/negative skew, result from the `<u>`outliers occurrence `</u>`.
  - Type:
    - Positively Skewed: outliers > mean, skewed right, long upper tail.
    - Negatively Skewed: outliers < mean, skewed left, long lower tail.
  - The relationship between Mean, Median, Mode:
    - Symmetrical distribution: `mean=median=mode`
    - For positive skewed, `mode < median < mean`
    - For negative skewed, `mean < median < mode`
    - Rule(easy to remember the order):
      - The effect of skew pays more attention on **mean**, other than median and mode.
      - mean is `<u>`in the same direction `</u>` of the skew.
      - Besides, `<u>`median `</u>` always stays between mean and mode, regardless the skewness direction.
  - **Sample Skewness**:
    - Function: $Sample \space Skewness=\frac{1}{n}*\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})^3}{s^3}$
      - the denominator > 0, while the sign of **numerator** depend on the `<u>`skewness direction `</u>`.
      - if $|Sample Skewness|>0.5$, treated as _significant_.
- **kurtosis**:
  - Definition: the degree of a distribution is **more or less peaked** than a _normal distribution_
  - Types:
    - Lepokurtic: more peaked
      - in investment, a _greater_ likelihood of a large deviation from the expected return usually received as an `<u>`increase in risk `</u>`.
    - Platykurtic: flatter, less peaked
    - Mesokurtic: the same kurtosis as $N dist$
  - **Excess Kurtosis**: _more or less kurtosis part_ than the normal distribution.
    - Mesokurtic EK=0;
    - Lepokurtic EK>0;
    - Platykurtic EK<0;
  - **Sample Kurtosis**:
    - function: $Sample \space Kurtosis=\frac{1}{n}*\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar{X})^4}{s^4}$
  - $Excess \space Kurtosis=Sample \space Kurtosis-3$
- **Correlation**
  - **Covariance**: how two variables move together
  - For Sample Covariance, the function: $S_{X,Y}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n[(X_i-\bar{X})(Y_i-\bar{Y})]}{n-1}$
    - the value is depend on the **units** of variables. Hence, the covariance `<u>`cannot `</u>` show the `<u>`relative strength `</u>` of the relationship, but only discloses the `<u>`move direction `</u>` whether the same or opposite.
  - **Correlation Coefficient**
    - Function: $\rho_{XY}=\frac{S_{XY}}{S_XS_Y}$
    - Properties:
      - range: $[-1, 1]$, without units, care about the `<u>`strength and movement direction `</u>` of the linear relationship between 2 variables.
  - **Visualization: Scatter Plots**
    - two variable relationship
    - it can reveal non-linear relationship, which cannot be shown by $\rho$.
  - Correlation != Causation.
  - **Spurious Correlation**‰º™ÂÖ≥Á≥ª
    - the relationship between two variables caused by association with a `<u>`third variable or by chance `</u>`.
