# Reading 20 Understanding Cash Flow Statement

## 1. Cash Flow Introduction

- Cash Flow Statement
  - based on accrual
  - reflect cash receipts and cash payments
  - operating, financing, investing activities
  - cash payment and receipts from income statement and balance sheet
- Information provides to financial analyst to judge:
  - whether unexpected obligations can be met
  - can take advantage of new business opportunities
  - the needs of additional financing 
  - daily operations can generate enough cash to sustain business
  - enough cash to payoff existing debts
  
### 1) Cash Flow from Operating, Investing, Financing

- CFO
  - transactions affect net income
  - interest and dividend receive/paid
  - sale proceed from/acquisition trading securities
  - Tax paid
- CFI
  - come from acquisition, disposal of long-term assets, certain investment
  - sales proceed from/acquisition of fixed asset, debt and equity investments
  - principle receive from loans to others, loan made to others
- CFF
  - transactions affect capital structure
  - principle of debt issued
  - principle paid on debt or leases
  - reacquire stock payments/proceeds from stock issuing
  - dividend paid to shareholders

### 2) Non-cash Investing and Financing Activities Reporting

- <u>Not reported</u> in cash flow statement
- will be denoted on footnote or supplemental schedule
- eg: 
  - firm acquires real state with financing provided by the seller
  - an exchange of debt for equity

### 3) Cash Flow Statement Preparation under IFRS and GAAP

- GAAP
  - Dividend paid to shareholders→financing
  - Interest paid→operating
  - Interest and dividend *received* from investment→operating
  - all income tax paid→operating
- IFRS
  - Interest and dividend *received* from investment→operating or investing
  - Dividend paid to shareholders and interest paid on debts→operating or financing
  - income tax paid→operating unless it is related to investing and financing transaction

### 4) Direct and Indirect Methods for Operating Activities

- Reality Facts
  - both methods are permitted in GAAP and IFRS
  - the results are the same
  - <u>direct method</u> is preferred by both methods
  - the differences is how to present cash flows of <u>operating activities</u>
- Direct
  - rule: each accrual-based income statement line→cash receipts and payment(accrual→cash-based)
  - timing: the revenue/expense recognition != related cash flows
  - format: cash collections items-cash paid items=operating cash flow
- Indirect
  - rule: adjust for transactions that affect *net income* but not cash transactions
    1. eliminate non-cash expenses: eg. depreciation, amortization
    2. eliminate non-operating items: gains and losses
    3. eliminate <u>changes</u> in *balance sheet* accounts resulting from <u>accrual accounting items</u>
    - eg: account payable, account receivable, prepaid expenses, unearned revenue, deferred income tax
  - format: net income-adjustment to reconcile=operating cash flow
- Arguments in Favor of Each Method
  - Advantage of Direct Method
    - provide more information about *past* <u>receipts and payments</u> to *forecasting future* operating cash flows.
  - Advantage of Indirect Method
    - focus on the differences between <u>net income and operating cash flow</u>
    - provide useful links between <u>income statement</u> for forecasting future operating cash flows
- Disclosure Requirements
  - GAAP: 
    - <u>reconcile</u> net income to cash flow from operating activities is required
    - payments for interest and tax be disclosed on *cash flow statement or footnotes*
  - IFRS
    - net income reconcile is not required
    - payments for interest and tax be disclosed separately on cash flow statement direct and indirect methods

### 5) The Relationship with Income Statement and Balance Sheet

- Cash flow statement reconcile structure:
  - CFO+CFI+CFF = Change in cash balance+Beginning cash balance=Ending cash balance
- Relationship with balance sheet accounts
  - Except some special cases, mostly <u>current assets and liabilities accounts</u> related to *operating* activities.
  - **Noncurrent assets** related to *investing* activities
  - <u>Noncurrent liabilities and equity</u> related to *financing* activities
  - <u>Timing different</u> between accrual- and cash-based recognition reflects on balance sheet.

## 4. Free Cash Flow and Ratios

### 1) Free Cash Flow to Firm(FCFF)

- Definition: cash available to all investors, both equity and debt holders
- Calculation formula: 
  - from net income: $FCFF=NI+NCC+[Int*(1-t)]-FCInv-WCInv$
    - $NCC$: non-cash charges(depreciation or amortization)
    - $Int$: cash interest paid
    - $FCInv$: fixed capital investment
    - $WCInv$: working capital investment
  - from operating cash flow: $FCFF=CFO+[Int(1-t)]-FCInv$

### 2) Free Cash Flow to Equity(FCFE)

- Definition: available to common shareholders
- Calculation formula: $FCFF=CFO-FCInv-Net \space Borrowing$
  - $Net \space Borrowing=debt \space issued-debt \space paid$

### 3) Cash Flow Ratios

- Performance Ratio
- Coverage Ratio
