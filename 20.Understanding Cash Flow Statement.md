# Reading 20 Understanding Cash Flow Statement

## 1. Cash Flow Introduction

- Cash Flow Statement
  - based on accrual
  - reflect cash receipts and cash payments
  - operating, financing, investing activities
  - cash payment and receipts from income statement and balance sheet
- Information provides to financial analyst to judge:
  - whether unexpected obligations can be met
  - can take advantage of new business opportunities
  - the needs of additional financing 
  - daily operations can generate enough cash to sustain business
  - enough cash to payoff existing debts
  
### 1) Cash Flow from Operating, Investing, Financing

- CFO
  - transactions affect net income
  - interest and dividend receive/paid
  - sale proceed from/acquisition trading securities
  - Tax paid
- CFI
  - come from acquisition, disposal of long-term assets, certain investment
  - sales proceed from/acquisition of fixed asset, debt and equity investments
  - principle receive from loans to others, loan made to others
- CFF
  - transactions affect capital structure
  - principle of debt issued
  - principle paid on debt or leases
  - reacquire stock payments/proceeds from stock issuing
  - dividend paid to shareholders

### 2) Non-cash Investing and Financing Activities Reporting

- <u>Not reported</u> in cash flow statement
- will be denoted on footnote or supplemental schedule
- eg: 
  - firm acquires real state with financing provided by the seller
  - an exchange of debt for equity

### 3) Cash Flow Statement Preparation under IFRS and GAAP

- GAAP
  - Dividend paid to shareholders‚Üífinancing
  - Interest paid‚Üíoperating
  - Interest and dividend *received* from investment‚Üíoperating
  - all income tax paid‚Üíoperating
- IFRS
  - Interest and dividend *received* from investment‚Üíoperating or investing
  - Dividend paid to shareholders and interest paid on debts‚Üíoperating or financing
  - income tax paid‚Üíoperating unless it is related to investing and financing transaction

### 4) Direct and Indirect Methods for Operating Activities

- Reality Facts
  - both methods are permitted in GAAP and IFRS
  - the results are the same
  - <u>direct method</u> is preferred by both methods
  - under GAAP, footnotes of direct method must contain indirect method disclosure
  - the differences is how to present cash flows of <u>operating activities</u>
- Direct
  - rule: each accrual-based income statement line‚Üícash receipts and payment(accrual‚Üícash-based)
  - timing: the revenue/expense recognition != related cash flows
  - format: cash collections items-cash paid items=operating cash flow
- Indirect
  - rule: adjust for transactions that affect *net income* but not cash transactions
    1. eliminate non-cash expenses: eg. depreciation, amortization
    2. eliminate non-operating items: gains and losses
    3. eliminate <u>changes</u> in *balance sheet* accounts resulting from <u>accrual accounting items</u>
    - eg: account payable, account receivable, prepaid expenses, unearned revenue, deferred income tax
  - format: net income-adjustment to reconcile=operating cash flow
- Arguments in Favor of Each Method
  - Advantage of Direct Method
    - provide more information about *past* <u>receipts and payments</u> to *forecasting future* operating cash flows.
  - Advantage of Indirect Method
    - focus on the differences between <u>net income and operating cash flow</u>
    - provide useful links between <u>income statement</u> for forecasting future operating cash flows
- Disclosure Requirements
  - GAAP: 
    - <u>reconcile</u> net income to cash flow from operating activities is required
    - payments for interest and tax be disclosed on *cash flow statement or footnotes*
  - IFRS
    - net income reconcile is not required
    - payments for interest and tax be disclosed separately on cash flow statement direct and indirect methods

### 5) The Relationship with Income Statement and Balance Sheet

- Cash flow statement reconcile structure:
  - CFO+CFI+CFF = Change in cash balance+Beginning cash balance=Ending cash balance
- Relationship with balance sheet accounts
  - Except some special cases, mostly <u>current assets and liabilities accounts</u> related to *operating* activities.
  - **Noncurrent assets** related to *investing* activities
  - <u>Noncurrent liabilities and equity</u> related to *financing* activities
  - <u>Timing different</u> between accrual- and cash-based recognition reflects on balance sheet.
  - changes in assets/changes in liabilities have negative/positive effects on cash flow changes.

## 2. Direct and Indirect Method

### 1) Direct Method

- Analyst can see the actual amount went to each use of cash & received from each source of cash
- CFO common component:
  - cash collected from customers
  - cash used for production of goods and service
  - cash operating expenses
  - cash paid for interest and tax
  - Ignore non-cash charge: eg. depreciation or amortization expense
- CFI calculation: 
  - changes in <u>gross asset accounts</u> which related to *investing* activities.
  - eg: PPE, intangible assets, investment securities
  - gross: amount present on BS *before* <u>subtracting accumulated depreciation/amortization expenses</u>.
  - Cash paid for new assets=ending gross assets + gross cost of old assets sold - beginning gross assets
    - reconcile: ‚ùóÔ∏èBeginning gross assets+cash paid for new assets-gross cost of assets sold=ending gross assets
  - cash from asset sold=book value of asset+gain(-loss) on sale
- CFF calculation:
  - cash flows occurring between firm and its capital suppliers
  - net cash flow from creditors=new borrowing-principle amounts repaid
  - net cash flow from shareholder=new equity issued-shares repurchases-cash dividend paid
    - cash dividend paid=dividend declared +/- changes in dividend payable
- total cash flow=CFO+CFF+CFI=cash flow changes declared on *balance sheet*

### 2) Indirect Method

- CFO Presentationüåü
  - begin with <u>net income</u>, adjustment the differences between accounting items and cash payment and receipts
    - *non-cash accounts* add back, eg: depreciation expense are deducted net income, we should add back for CFO calculation
    - subtract/add back gains/losses from *investing and financing* cash flows to net income, eg: assets disposal
    - ‚ùóÔ∏èadd/subtract changes in balance sheet accounts,eg: account receivable VS cash collection, account payable VS cash payment to suppliers
      - operating asset account: ‚Üë(-), ‚Üì(+)
      - operating liability assets: ‚Üë(+), ‚Üì(-)
- CFI and CFF are the same with Direct method.

## 3. Converting Indirect to Direct

### 1) Demonstration of Conversion

- We only need to convert CFO part, using information from indirect cash flow statements and income statements
- General Rule:
  - adjust income statement item's corresponding balance sheet accounts
  - eliminate <u>non-cash and non-operating</u> items
- Two Components:
  - Cash collection from customers
    - start from *net sales* in income statement
    - subtract(add back) increase(decrease) in account receivables reported in indirect method
    - add(subtract) increase(decrease) in unearned revenue
  - Cash payments to suppliers
    - start from COGS in income statement
    - add back any depreciation/amortization accounts (non-cash)
    - deduct(add back) any increase(decrease) in account payable reported in indirect method
    - deduct(add back) any decrease(increase) in inventory account reported in indirect method
    - deduct an inventory write-off, which result from applying the min(cost, market value), increasing COGS & decreasing ending inventory balance (non-cash for written-off)

### 2) Reported and Common-size Cash Flow Statement

- Major Source and Use of Cash
  - in long term, successful firms must generate enough operating CF >> capital expenditures and provide a return to debt and equity holders
  - in beginning of firm life cycle: may experience negative operating CF which used to finance increase account receivable and inventory internally, externally sourced from issuing debt or equity securities.
- CFO
  - <u>major determinants</u> of operating CF should be identified
  - positive operating CF generated by decreasing non-cash WC, eg: inventories, receivables, increasing payable
    - decreasing non-cash WC is not sustainable
  - provide a check of firm earnings quality
    - more stable, higher quality
    - earnings >> operating CF-->aggressive accounting choice. ie: recognize revenue too soon or delay expenses recognition
- CFI
  - the <u>source and usage</u> should be examined
  - capital expenditures‚Üë, an indication of growth
  - capital expenditures‚Üì or sell capital assets, to save or generate cash --> cash outflows in the future‚Üë, owing to older assets are replaced
  - if Operating CF generation >> capital expenditure-->desirable
- CFF
  - reveals firm generates cash flow by <u>issuing debt or equity</u>
  - provide information of cash usage: debt repayment, stock reacquiring, pay dividend
- Common-size Cash Flow Statement
  - Rule: 
    - each line item as a percentage of *revenue*, OR
    - alternatively, each inflow of cash expressed as a percentage of <u>total cash inflows</u>
    - each outflow of cash expressed as a percentage of <u>total cash outflows</u>
  - *revenue-based* common-size cash flow statement functions:
    - trend identification
    - future cash flow forecasting

## 4. Free Cash Flow and Ratios

### 1) Free Cash Flow to Firm(FCFF)

- Definition: cash available to all investors, both equity and debt holders
- Calculation formula: 
  - from net income: $FCFF=NI+NCC+[Int*(1-t)]-FCInv-WCInv$
    - $NCC$: non-cash charges(depreciation or amortization)
    - $Int$: cash interest paid
    - $FCInv$: fixed capital investment
    - $WCInv$: working capital investment
  - from operating cash flow: $FCFF=CFO+[Int(1-t)]-FCInv$

### 2) Free Cash Flow to Equity(FCFE)

- Definition: available to common shareholders
- Calculation formula: $FCFE=CFO-FCInv+Net \space Borrowing$
  - $Net \space Borrowing=debt \space issued-debt \space paid$
  - if under IFRS calculating CFO by subtracting dividend paid, this amount should be added back to calculate FCFE.

### 3) Cash Flow Ratios

- Performance Ratio
  - cash flow to revenue=CFO/net revenue
    - the amount of operating cash flow generated for each dollar of revenue.
  - cash return on assets ratio=CFO/average total assets
    - ......attributed to all providers of capital
  - cash return on equity ratio=CFO/average total equity
    - ......attributed to shareholders
  - cash to income ratio=CFO/operating income
    - the ability to generate cash flow from firm operations
  - cash flow per share=(CFO-preferred dividends)/weighted average number of common stock
    - an alternative way to calculate basic EPS using CFO instead of net income
- Coverage Ratio
  - debt average ratio=CFO/total debt
    - measures risk and leverage
  - interest coverage ratio=(CFO+interest paid+taxes paid)/interest paid
    - measures firm's ability to meet interest obligations
    - if interest paid is classified as financing activities, no adjustment is needed.
  - reinvestment ratio=CFO/cash paid for long-term assets
    - ability to *acquire long-term assets* with operating cash flow
  - debt payment ratio=CFO/cash long-term debt repayment
    - ability to satisfy *long-term debt* with operating cash flow
  - dividend payment ratio=CFO/dividends paid
    - ability to make dividend payment from CFO
  - investing and financing ratio=CFO/cash outflows from investing and financing activities
    - ability to purchase assets, satisfy debts, pay dividends
