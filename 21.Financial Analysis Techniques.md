# Reading 21 Financial Analysis Techniques

## 1. Introduction to Financial Ratios

### 1) Tools and Technique used in Financial Analysis

- Ratio Analysis
  - used for internal comparison, firms comparison
  - used to identify the questions need to be answered
  - Limitations: 
    - not useful if only shown isolated, comparison is needed to gain information
    - comparison between different firms which use different accounting treatments is difficult
      - definitions of ratios are vary widely, among industry, country, region
    - find a comparable industry ratios for comparison is difficult
    - single ratio can not used to draw a useful conclusion, all financial ratios are acceptable
    - range is required, due to find a target value选单一值为参照很难
- Common-size Analysis
  - Types:
    - Vertical
      - present most recent period on left
      - financial leverage(long-term debt to total assets) can be grasped 
    - Horizontal
      - find a base-year(usually we use the <u>first year</u> of selected period) standardized as **1.0**
      - used to check <u>trend and relative growth</u> over time
      - present most recent period on right
  - Used to give analyst a right direction to <u>find out determinants</u> led to increase in *net profit margin* and future effect or trend
    - net profit margin=net income/revenues (in income statement)
      - The percentage of each dollar of sales that remains for shareholders
- Graphical Analysis: performance comparison and composition of FS over time
  - Stacked column/bar graph: 
    - change in items from year to year
    - X-axis: fiscal year
    - bar: different amount of account items
  - Line graph
    - X-axis: fiscal year
    - line: account item in financial statement
- Regression Analysis
  - identify relationships between variables
  - used for forecasting

## 2. Financial Ratios

- Activity Ratios
  - indication: how well a firm utilize various asset items, disclosure asset utilization or turnover ratios, operating efficiency
  - **receivable turnover**=annual sales revenue/average receivables
    - average receivables=(beginning balance+ending balance)/2
    - higher:
      - better credit term management and collections, 
      - company offers a tight credit term 
        - larger discount for early payment
        - high penalty required for late payment
        - if it is extreme, company will lose sales
        - <u>higher revenue growth</u> compared with peers' average
  - **days of sales outstanding**=365/receivables turnover
    - also called *average collection period*
  - **inventory turnover**=cost of goods sold/average inventory
    - firms' inventory processing and management efficiency
    - high←low holding inventory level→sales losing, OR efficient inventory management
    - low→inventories are obsolete and slow selling
  - **days of inventory on hand**=365/inventory turnover
    - also called *average inventory processing period*
  - **payable turnover**=purchases/average trade payable
    - measure use of trade credit
    - purchases=ending inventory balance-beginning inventory balance+cost of goods sold
    - <u>high</u> relative to peers, *not fully* take average of supplier *credit terms*, or company pay creditors *early* to take advantage of *discounts*
    - low, company may have a problem with *short-term cash flow*, or take advantage of <u>lenient terms</u> negotiated with suppliers
  - **number of days of payable**=365/payable turnover ratio
    - also called *payable payment period*
    - measures average amount of time it takes the company to pay the bills
  - **total asset turnover**=revenue/average total assets
    - the use of total assets to create revenue
    - too low, firm has too much capital tied up in asset base.
    - too high, company has too few assets for potential sales, or the assets are <u>outdated</u>.
  - **fixed asset turnover**=revenue/average net fixed assets
    - measures utilization of fixed assets, net of accumulated depreciation
    - low, use assets inefficiently, or company has too much capital tied up in asset base.
    - too high, firm has *obsolete* equipment, or company has to incur <u>capital expenditures</u> in the near future to increase capacity to support growing revenues.
    - *more recently acquired* assets have <u>lower ratios</u>.
  - **working capital turnover**=revenue/average working capital
    - how efficiently a company using working capital
    - working capital=current assets-current liability
- Liquidity Ratios
  - firms' ability to payoff short-term obligation as its due
  - **current ratio**=current asset/current liability
    - the higher, more ability to payoff short-term bills
    - if < 1, company has negative working capital and facing liquidity crisis
  - **quick ratio**=(cash+marketable securities+receivables)/current liabilities
    - doesn't include not so liquidity asset items, eg: inventories
    - higher, more likely to payoff short-term bills
    - marketable securities: short-term debt instruments
  - **cash ratio**=(cash+marketable securities)/current liabilities
    - most conservation liquidity measures
    - higher, more likely to payoff short-term bills
  - **defense interval ratio**=(cash+marketable securities+receivables)/average daily expenditures
    - means number of days average cash expenditures the firm could pay with current liquid assets.
    - daily expenditures components: 
      - COGS, SG&A, R&D
      - non-cash charge such as depreciation expense should be added back
  - **cash conversion cycle**=days sale outstanding+days of inventory on hand-number of days of payable
    - means the length of time takes to turn cash investment in inventory back to cash which indicates cash collections from inventory sales
    - high, undesirable, means company has an <u>excessive amount of capital investment</u> in sales.
- Solvency Ratios
  - firm's financial leverage, ability to payoff long-term obligation
  - **debt-to-equity**=total debt/total shareholders' equity
    - use of fixed-cost financing sources, the degree of reliance on debt as a source of financing
    - total debt=long-term debt+interest-bearing short term debt, which is *different from* analysts or FS providers.
      - some analyst includes <u>PV of lease obligation</u>, or <u>non-interest-bearing</u> current liabilities, such as trade payable
  - **debt-to-asset ratio**=total debt/(total debt+total shareholder equity)
    - reveal the degree of reliance on debt as a source of financing
  - **financial leverage**=average total assets/average total equity
    - indicates firms' usage of debt financing
    - higher, more risk to equity and bond holders
  - **interest coverage**=earnings before interest and taxes/interest payments
    - lower, firm has more difficulties to meet debt payments
  - **debt-to-EBITDA**=total debt/EBITDA
    - add back <u>depreciation and amortization expense</u> to denominator
  - **fixed charge coverage**=(earnings before interest and taxes+lease payment)/(interest payments+lease payments)
    - add back lease to denominator and numerator, treated as portion of assets
- Profitability Ratios
  - how well company *generates operating profits and net profits* from sales
  - **net profit margin**=net income from continuing operations/revenue
    - too low is a concerned risky signal
  - **gross profit margin**=gross profit/revenue
    - gross profit=sales-COGS
    - too <u>low</u> is a concerned risky signal, while the ability to *raise prices* may limited by competition.
  - **operating profit margin**=operating income/revenue or EBIT/revenue
    - operating income=gross-SA&G
    - EBIT: earnings before interest and taxes, include non-operating items
    - too low is a concerned risky signal
  - **pretax margin**=EBT/revenue
    - EBT: earning before tax, = operating earnings-interest
  - **Return on Assets**= net income/average total assets
    - measures profitability relative to funds invested by common stock, preferred stock, debt holders
    - alternative calculation: **return on asset**=(net income+interest expense(1-t))/average total assets
      - add back interest expense net of taxes
  - **Operating Return on Asset**=operating income/average total assets, OR =EBIT/average total assets
    - include taxes and interest
  - **return on total capital**(ROTC)=EBIT/average total capital
    - too low is a concerned risky signal
  - **return on equity(ROE)**=net income/average total equity
    - too low is a concerned risky signal
    - include preferred stock
  - **return on common equity**=(net income-preferred dividend)/average common equity=net income available to common/average common equity
    - only care about the profits available to common shareholders
- Valuation Ratios
  - ratios to compare relative valuation of companies, and analysis for investment in common equity 
  - per-share valuation
    - Basic EPS=net income available to common/weighted average number of outstanding common shares
    - Diluted EPS: 
      - diluted securities include: convertible debt, convertible preferred stock, options and warrants
    - cash flow per share, EBIT per share, EBITDA per share
    - per share measures are *not comparable*, owing to <u>numbers of outstanding shares</u> differ among firms
  - Dividends Related: per common share basis
    - Retained earnings=net income-dividend declared
      - RE used to corporation growth
    - sustainable growth rate: the proportion of net income retained to *fund growth*
      - Formula: $g=RR/ROE$
        - $RR$: retention rate, the proportion of earnings reinvested
          - retention rate=(net income available to common-dividend declared)/net income available to common=1-dividend payout ratio=1-(dividend declared/net income available to common)
        - ROE: rate of return
      - how fast firm can grow without additional external equity issue and leverage is holding constant
  - industrial related ratios
    - for consulting and service companies valuation: 
      - net income per employee
      - sales per employee
    - for retail industry:
      - sales per square foot
    - for restaurant or retail industry:
      - growth in same-store sales
        - indicate growth without new location opened effect, measuring how well firm is doing to attract and keeping customers, new locations are taking customers from existing ones
  - Business Risk
    - Coefficient of Variation for a variable
      - =$std/E(x)$
      - size adjustment measure of variation
      - reveal <u>uncertainty and risk</u> about firm's performance
      - CV sales=std of sales/mean sales
      - CV operating income=std of operating income/mean operating income
      - CV net income=std of net income/mean net income
    - Capital adequacy ratio资本充足率
      - the ratio of a bank's capital in relation to risk weighted assets and current liabilities
      - common measure of `capital risk`: VaR
        - maximum dollar size of loss that firm will exceed over a period of time, at a pre-defined confidence level
      - Banks: 
        - minimum reserve requirements
        - liquid asset requirements=banks' liquid assets/certain liabilities
      - Financial companies:
        - net interest margin=interest income/interest-bearing assets
          - measure performance lend funds
  - Credit Analysis
    - the firms' ability to service and repay the debt
    - ratios used to analyze and forecast <u>firm bankruptcies</u>
      - `Altman Z-score`: 
        - lower, more possible to failure
        - formula: $Altman \space Z-score=1.2A+1.4B+3.3C+0.6D+1.0E$
          - $A$: working capital/total asset
          - $B$: retained earnings/total asset
          - $C$: EBIT/total asset
          - $D$: market value of equity/total liabilities
          - $E$: sales revenue/total assets
        - if score<1.8, firm is likely to be bankrupt.
        - if score>3.0, firm is not likely to be bankrupt.
- Segment Reporting and Segment Ratios
  - Business Segment
    - Definition: a portion size of large company > 10%
  - Geographic Segment
    - a portion size of large company > 10%
    - the geographical unit has business environment different from other segments'
  - Both GAAP and IFRS require report segment data, which stated as a <u>subset</u> of required disclosures
    - Analyst can prepare detailed analysis and forecast for segments performance separately
  - *segment profit margin, asset turnover, ROA* are useful to **analysis** for operations.
  - As for forecasting, <u>growth rate of segment revenues and profits</u> can be used

## 3. Dupont Analysis

### Demonstration Dupont Analysis on ROE

- Three-part Approach
  - ROE=net income/average equity=(net income/revenue) × (revenue/average equity)= net profit margin × equity turnover= (net income/revenue) × (revenue/average total assets) × (average total assets/equity)=net profit margin × asset turnover × financial leverage ratio
- Five-part Approach
  - ROE=(net income/EBT) × (EBT/EBIT) × (EBIT/revenue) × (revenue/average assets) × (average assets/average equity)= tax burden ratio × interest burden ratio × EBIT margin × asset turnover × financial leverage
    - interest expense↑, interest burden ratio↓; tax expense↑, tax burden ratio↓ →→ROE↓
    - EBIT can be replaced by *operating earnings*, then we have <u>operating margin</u>
    - more leverage doesn't always lead to high ROE
      - leverage↑, then interest expense↑
