# Reading 22 Inventories

## 1. Cost Flow Methods

- Manufacturing firms report inventories in three separate account:
  - raw materials
  - work-in-process
  - finished goods
- ❗️Relationships:
  - COGS=beginning inventory-ending inventory+purchases
  - Purchases=ending inventory-beginning inventory+COGS
  - Beginning inventory=COGS - purchases + ending inventory
  - Ending inventory=beginning inventory+purchases-COGS *(Easiest to remember)*

- Cost Reported as `Inventory` OR as `Expenses`
  - cost is most inventories' valuation basis
  - **Product Costs**(Capitalize)
    - Product costs minus <u>trade discounts and rebates</u>
    - Conversion costs including labor and overhead
    - Other costs are necessary to bring inventory to required location and condition
  - **Period Costs**(Expenses)
    - Administration overhead
    - Selling cost
    - Storage cost
    - Abnormal waste of raw material, labor, overhead

- Different Inventory Valuation Methods(firm can use >=1 methods)
  - Specific Identification: each units cost↔︎unit' actual cost
  - FIFO
    - Advantages: <u>ending inventory</u> is based on most current purchases
    - COGS is based on *earliest* purchase costs
    - Under inflationary environment, COGS underestimated, earnings overestimated
  - LIFO
    - <u>under inflationary environment</u>, COGS higher than that of FIFO, earnings lower, income tax↓, cash flow↑
      - ending inventory < current cost
    - Ending inventories is values using *earliest* costs.
  - Weighted Average Cost
    - Advantage: simple and objective
    - Computation:
      - average cost per unit=total cost of goods **available** for sale(=beginning inventory+purchases)/total quantity available for sale
      - COGS=average cost per unit * number of goods sold
      - ending inventory=average cost per unit * number of units remain
    - Under inflationary/deflationary environment, weighted average cost gains the value **between** FIFO and LIFO

## 2. Inventory System

- Periodic inventory system
  - inventory values and COGS are determined at *the end of accounting period*.
  - `Purchase Account`: report inventory acquired *during period* is needed.
- Perpetual inventory system
  - inventory valuation and COGS are *updated continuously*.
  - related accounts are recorded directly in inventory when transaction occur.
  - Purchase account is <u>not necessary</u>.
- notes: 
  - For **FIFO and specific identification methods**, ending inventory and COGS valuation <u>are the same</u> with whether a periodic or perpetual system.
  - For **LIFO or Weighted Average Cost Method**, the <u>valuation are different</u> using in periodic or perpetual system.
- The effect of deflation and inflation of inventory costs
