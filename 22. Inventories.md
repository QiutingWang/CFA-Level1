# Reading 22 Inventories

## 1. Cost Flow Methods

- Manufacturing firms report inventories in three separate account:
  - raw materials
  - work-in-process
  - finished goods
- ‚ùóÔ∏èRelationships:
  - COGS=beginning inventory-ending inventory+purchases
  - Purchases=ending inventory-beginning inventory+COGS
  - Beginning inventory=COGS - purchases + ending inventory
  - Ending inventory=beginning inventory+purchases-COGS *(Easiest to remember)*

- Cost Reported as `Inventory` OR as `Expenses`
  - cost is most inventories' valuation basis
  - **Product Costs**(Capitalize)
    - Product costs minus <u>trade discounts and rebates</u>
    - Conversion costs including labor and overhead
    - Other costs are necessary to bring inventory to required location and condition
  - **Period Costs**(Expenses)
    - Administration overhead
    - Selling cost
    - Storage cost
    - Abnormal waste of raw material, labor, overhead

- Different Inventory Valuation Methods(firm can use >=1 methods)
  - Specific Identification: each units cost‚ÜîÔ∏éunit' actual cost
  - FIFO
    - Advantages: <u>ending inventory</u> is based on most current purchases
    - COGS is based on *earliest* purchase costs
    - Under inflationary environment, COGS underestimated, earnings overestimated
  - LIFO
    - <u>under inflationary environment</u>, COGS higher than that of FIFO, earnings lower, income tax‚Üì, cash flow‚Üë
      - ending inventory < current cost
    - Ending inventories is values using *earliest* costs.
  - Weighted Average Cost
    - Advantage: simple and objective
    - Computation:
      - average cost per unit=total cost of goods **available** for sale(=beginning inventory+purchases)/total quantity available for sale
      - COGS=average cost per unit * number of goods sold
      - ending inventory=average cost per unit * number of units remain
    - Under inflationary/deflationary environment, weighted average cost gains the value **between** FIFO and LIFO

## 2. Inventory System

- Periodic inventory system
  - inventory values and COGS are determined at *the end of accounting period*.
  - `Purchase Account`: report inventory acquired *during period* is needed.
- Perpetual inventory system
  - inventory valuation and COGS are *updated continuously*.
  - related accounts are recorded directly in inventory when transaction occur.
  - Purchase account is <u>not necessary</u>.
- notes: 
  - For **FIFO and specific identification methods**, ending inventory and COGS valuation <u>are the same</u> with whether a periodic or perpetual system.
  - For **LIFO or Weighted Average Cost Method**, the <u>valuation are different</u> using in periodic or perpetual system.
- The effect of <u>deflation and inflation</u> of inventory costs on financial Statement and ratios with different valuation methods
  - Inflationary, stable & increasing inventory quantities, 
    - COGS: LIFO > FIFO
    - Net income and Gross profit: LIFO < FIFO --> Taxes: LIFO < FIFO
    - Ending Inventory: LIFO < FIFO
    - **costs per unit** of sold and remaining are reported on balance sheet and income statement.
  - Deflationary, stable & increasing inventory quantities, in reverse.
  - Price level *stable*, all three methods gain the <u>same amount</u> of COGS, Ending Inventory, Gross Profit.
  - Useful Measure to Reflect Current Situation:
    - Ending inventory: FIFO
    - COGS: LIFO
  
## 3. Converting LIFO to FIFO for Comparison

### 1) LIFO Reserve, Effects on Financial Statement, and LIFO ‚Üí FIFO Conversion

- LIFO Reserve:
  - Definition: When price is raising, the amount of inventory valuation difference under LIFO and FIFO methods. (LIFO < FIFO)
- Conversion Tricks:üå∏
  - **add** LIFO Reserve to LIFO `Inventory` account in BS
  - increase `Retrained Earning` by <u>LIFO reserve*(1-TaxRate)</u> of Shareholders' Equity
  - decrease `Cash` account by <u>LIFO reserve*(1-TaxRate)</u>.
  - FIFO `COGS`=LIFO COGS-(Ending LIFO reserve-Beginning LIFO reserve)=LIFO COGS-$\Delta$LIFO Reserve
- Effects on Ratios of LIFO->FIFO
  - Probability: measures that related to COGS, **Higher** under FIFO.
    - eg: gross/operating/net profit margins‚Üë
  - Liquidity: LIFO results lower inventory value(current asset)
    - <u>Working Capital, Current Ratio</u> ‚Üë under FIFO
  - Activity: Inventory turnover ratio‚Üì, days of inventory on hand‚Üë
  - Solvency: higher total assets under FIFO-->higher equity(asset-liability)
    - debt ratio, debt-to-equity ratio ‚Üì

### 2) LIFO Liquidation, Effects on Financial Statement, and LIFO ‚Üí FIFO Conversion

- LIFO Liquidation:
  - Definition: When price is falling OR inventory quantity of LIFO company decline, the amount of inventory valuation difference under LIFO and FIFO methods. 
  - Inventory values: LIFO > FIFO
  - COGS: LIFO < FIFO
  - higher profit margins and income taxes under LIFO

## 4. Inventory Valuation

### 1) Net Realizable Value Method and Implementation

- Definition: equals expected sales prices less estimated *selling and completion costs*.
- `Valuation Allowance Account`(contra-asset account)
  - Write Down:
    - when NRV < values disclosed on BS
      - *update inventory valuation* to NRV amount
      - the different is the <u>loss</u> should be recorded on *income statement*
  - Write Up:
    - subsequent value recovery exists
      - update the amount of `inventory` account on BS
      - `gain` is recognized on income statement
- Implementation
  - Commodity-like product:
    - In some industry, such as commodityÊúüË¥ß, inventory valuation > historical cost is allowed under GAAP and IFRS.
    - inventories reported as **NRV**, any <u>unrealizable gains or losses</u> recognized in income statement.
  - Write Down Effects: 
    - current assets&total asset‚Üì, current ratio‚Üì
    - inventory turnover‚Üë, cash conversion cycle‚Üì, days of inventory on hand‚Üì
    - total asset‚Üì, total asset turnover‚Üë, debt-to-asset ratio‚Üë
    - Retained earning(Equity)‚Üì, debt-to-equity ratio‚Üë
    - COGS‚Üë, gross\operating\net profit margin‚Üì
    - $\Delta \%‚Üì$net income > $\Delta \%‚Üì$asset or equity, ROA‚Üì, ROE‚Üì
  - After Write Down:
    - Inventory carrying value‚Üì --> COGS‚Üì, profitability‚Üë, reported ROA & ROE‚Üë

### 2) Lower of Cost or Market Method

- Definition:
  - Market Value = Replacement Cost(usually)
  - NRV-profit margin < Market Value <= NRV
- Write Down:
  - if cost< market value on BS:in income statement:
    - the decrease of value(loss) is written down <u>by COGS ‚Üë</u>, if the difference amount is small
    - written down <u>separately</u>, if the difference amount is large
  - **Cost** is the basis of determining whether to incur Impairment, <u>LIFO is less likely to recognize inventory write down</u> than other 2 methods.
- Write Up: 
  - if there is subsequent recovery:
    - <u>no write up</u> is needed under GAAP.
    - IFRS allows

### 3) Inventory Financial Statement Disclosure

- Inventories Disclosures:
  - Position: founded in FS **footnotes**
  - Usage: 
    - for company comparison with industry level
    - for inventory management
  - Content:
    - cost flow method: LIFO/FIFO/Weighted Average Cost
    - carrying values of inventory: 
      - total and by classification amounts
      - at *fair value-selling coss*
    - Inventory COGS during the period
    - inventory valuation written down/up amount
    - carrying value of inventories pledged as collateralÊäµÊäºÁâ©
  - Inventory Cost Method Changes:
    - Dealing <u>retrospectively</u>, sum up all prior-year differences between new and old methods as adjustment of beginning `retained earning` account.
    - Dealing prospectively when LIFO-->other cost methods, *no adjustment* in retained earning is needed. More simply, carrying value of inventory in ending LIFO method period=Beginning amount of new methods on inventory account.

### 4) Issues Matter for Analyst when Examining Inventory Information

- Future revenue and earnings forecast:
  - Raw material & WIP ‚Üë, demand‚Üë, future revenue‚Üë
  - Finished Goods‚Üë, raw material & WIP ‚Üì, demand‚Üì or inventory written down in future.
- Relationship between Sales & Finished Goods:
  - growth rate: Finished Goods>Sales Unit-->obsolete inventory, demand decline-->earning‚Üì
- Inventory Turnover Ratio:
  - high is desirable as <u>efficiency</u>:
    - with high sales growth rate & inventory turnover rato
  - But too high is undesirable potentially means:
    - may not carry enough inventories for satisfying demand-->lose sales
      - with small sales growth rate & high turnover ratio
    - <u>inventory write down</u> have been incurred
