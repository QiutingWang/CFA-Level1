# Reading 23 Long-lived Assets

## 1. Capitalize VS Expensing

### 1) Comparison between Capitalized and Expensing Cost

- Capitalized interest:
  - Definition: firms construct an asset <u>for its own use or resale</u>, the interest accrues during construction period capitalized.
  - Goal: match the cost with revenue generation well
  - Reporting Position:
    - not in income statement as interest expense
    - interest cost is allocated to **income statement** through `depreciation expense`(own use) or `COGS`(resale)
    - on cash flow statement:
      - Capitalized Interest reported as *investing* outflow
      - While, Interest Expense reported as:
        - GAAP: *operating* outflow
        - IFRS: operating/investing/financing outflow
  - Ratio Analysis:
    - Any *depreciation* of capitalized interest should <u>add back</u> when calculating income measures.

### 2) Types of Intangible Assets

- Identifiable or Not? -->can be purchased separately or arise from contractual/legal right
- Not all intangible asset reported on balance sheet, which depends on its type or nature.
- Types:
  - Created Internally
    - R&D: 
      - under IFRS research cost-->expensing; development cost-->capitalize
      - under GAAP, both are expensing. 
        - The development cost can be capitalized until the <u>product technological feasibility established</u>.
  - Purchased
    - capitalize at cost(fair value at acquisition)
  - Obtained in Business Combination
    - identifiable assets and liabilities: capitalized at purchase price
    - goodwill: as non-identifiable assets capitalized on balance sheet

### 3) Capitalized & Expensing Costs Affect Ratios and FS

- Net Income
  - Capitalize expenditure *delays recognition of expense*-->Net income higher than Expensing
  - Subsequently, allocated to income statement as depreciation expense-->Net income lower than Expensing
  - Capitalizing <u>reduces variability</u> of net income.分期递减
  - Over the life of assets, <u>total net incomes are equal</u> using capitalization or expensing.
- Shareholder's Equity
  - Compared with Expensing, Capitalize
    - Retained earning higher, shareholder's equity higher, total asset higher
    - Subsequently, above items will be reduced.
- Cash Flow from Operations
  - Compared with Expensing, Capitalize
    - higher operating cash flow, lower investing cash flow, owing to classification difference
    - total cash flow will be the same
    - Subsequent deprecation expense allocation is *non-cash item* that has *no effect* on cash flow statement.
- Financial Ratios
  - Compared with Expensing, Capitalize
    - debt-to-asset ratio & debt-to-equity ratio lower
    - initially result in higher ROE and ROA, subsequently getting lower
    - interest coverage ratio(EBIT/interest expense):
      - measure firms ability to cover required interest payment on debt
      - lower interest expense, higher interest coverage ratio

## 2. Depreciation

### 1) Different Depreciation Methods for PPE

- Important Terms
  - carrying value=historical cost-accumulated depreciation
  - historical cost: original purchase price of assets including installation and transportation cost.
    - Also called "gross investment in the asset"
  - Depreciation: operating expenses, non-cash item
    - economic depreciation: the <u>actual decline</u> in value of asset, a greater proportion during the beginning years.
- Types:
  - Straight line method
    - predominated method, the same amount each year
    - $DE=\frac{OriginalCost-SalvageValue}{UsefulLife}$
  - Accelerated depreciation 
    - traits: more depreciation expense recognized in the early years, less in later years.
      - *lower net income* in previous year compared with SL method
    - double-declining balance(DDB)
      - $DDB_{t}=\frac{2}{UsefulLife}*BeginningBookValue_{t}$
      - don't care about salvage value. Once carrying value reaches up to salvage value, no additional depreciation expense is recognized.
      - the calculation process different from SL method in <u>base amount(carrying value) is changed by years</u>.
  - Units-of-production method
    - based on *usage* instead of time, usually applied to *natural resources*(depletion)
    - $UoP=\frac{OrginalCost-SalvageValue}{LifeInOutputUnit}*OutputUnitDuringPeriod$
- Component Depreciation
  - IFRS requires separately report component depreciation and useful life estimations.零部件单独
  - allowed in GAAP, but seldom use.
- Total amounts of depreciations are the same with different methods.

### 2) The Effects of Depreciation Methods and Useful Life & Residual Value Assumptions

- Effect of Depreciation Methods: 
  - Think from <u>depreciation expense, net income, total assets, shareholder equity, ROA, ROE, asset turnover ratio</u> perspectives.
- Effect of Estimations on FS Manipulation:
  - longer estimated useful life-->annual depreciation↓, reported net income↑
  - higher estimated residual value-->the same effects as above.
  - if there exists a change in estimations:
    - <u>pervious</u> periods are *not affected*
    - going forward calculation using new estimations.
  - when firm *allocates depreciation expense between COGS and SG&A*, operating margin not affected, <u>gross margin & operating expenses</u> affected.

### 3) Difference Amortization Methods for Intangible Assets

- those with infinite life, the same as depreciation methods
- those with finite life, no amortization is required, but impairment test is needed annually.

### 4) The Effects of Amortization Methods and Useful Life & Residual Value Assumptions

- The same as depreciation part.

## 3. Impairment & Revaluation

### 1) Revaluation Model

- Under GAAP long-lived assets recorded as <u>depreciated costs</u>=original cost-AD&impairment
- Under IFRS long-lived assets recorded as cost method or **revaluation model** to report assets at fair value. But revaluation model is seldom used in reality.
  - first recorded as depreciated costs
  - at each revaluation date, report as fair value.
  - between revaluation dates, depreciation is recognized.
  - at first revaluation date:
    - if fair value < carrying value-->**loss** recorded in *income statement*
    - if fair value > carrying value-->the difference is <u>revaluation surplus</u>, as a component of *equity*
  - at subsequent revaluation date:
    - if fair value > carrying value-->**gain** recorded in income statement as previous loss reserves.
      - if gain amount > previous recorded losses, <u>the excess part</u> reported in `revaluation surplus` account.
    - if fair value < carrying value-->the differences going to <u>reduce revaluation surplus</u> account
      - if there exists any remaining value that *excess revaluation surplus amoun*t, report a **loss** in income statement

### 2) Impairment of PPE and Intangible Assets

- Impairment under IFRS
  - event or circumstance need impairment annually: significant decline in market value, physical condition significant change
  - happens when carrying value > recoverable value
  - if impaired: 
    - value on balance sheet write down to recoverable amount
    - loss recorded on income statement
    - identifiable long-lived assets can be reserved with original impairment loss <u>amount maximum limitation</u>.
- Impairment under GAAP
  - when firm not able to recover the carrying value through future use.不保值
  - Steps:
    - recoverability test
      - if carrying value > asset future un-discounted cash flow stream
    - loss measurement
      - asset value write down to fair value on BS
      - loss(carrying value-fair value) recorded on income statement
  - loss recovery is not permitted.
- Intangible Assets with Indefinite Life
  - impairment loss recognized when *carrying amount > fair value*
- Long-lived Assets Hold for Sales
  - the asset no longer amortized or depreciated
  - is impaired if carrying amount > fair value-selling cost
  - if impaired write down to **NRV**, *loss* recorded on income statement
  - loss cannot reserved under IFRS and GAAP

### 3) De-recognition

- Definition: long-lived asset *removed* from BS, occurred when assets are <u>sold, exchanged, or abandoned</u>.
- Sold: the difference between sales proceed and carrying value(original cost-DE-impairment loss)-->gain/loss
  - investing activities
- Abandoned: carrying value is removed from BS, the loss is recorded on income statement
- Exchanged: 
  - gain/losses recorded by comparing <u>carrying value and fair value of old asset</u>
  - removed carrying value of old asset from BS
  - record *fair value* of new asset on BS

### 4) Effects of These Three

- Impairment
  - asset book value↓, asset and equity↓
  - At year of impairment, net income↓-->ROE and ROA ↓, Asset turnover ratio↑
  - Subsequential years, depreciation amount ↓, net income higher-->ROE & ROA ↑, Asset turnover ratio↑ because of impairment charge
  - no effects on cash flows, it is a kind of *unrealized loss*
  - indicate firm not recognized sufficient depreciation or amortization expenses, overstate earnings.
    - an opportunity to manipulate earnings
    - management teams <u>prefer higher impairment charge</u>, for higher reported earnings and boosting ROE&ROA ratios.
- Revaluation
  - Under US GAAP: **upward revaluation** is not allowed, except *asset hold-for-sale* which allowed impairment loss reversed.
    - upward revaluation: higher total assets and equity, higher depreciation expense
  - Under IFRS: choose revaluation model or record at fair value

## 4. Fixed Asset Disclosure

### 1) Disclosure under IFRS & GAAP

- IFRS
  - PPE:
    - measurement basis: historical cost
    - useful life
    - depreciation rate
    - gross carrying value
    - accumulated depreciation
    - reconciliation of carrying value between beginning and ending
    - PPE Acquisition agreement in future
  - with Revaluation
    - revaluation date
    - how to determine fair value
    - carrying value calculation
  - Intangible asset: disclosure whether it is identifiable.
  - with impairment test
    - impairment losses and reversal amount by asset classes
    - where impairment losses and reversal appear in income statement
    - Causing circumstance and events
- GAAP 
  - PPE
    - period depreciation expense
    - accumulated depreciation by classes in total
    - depreciation method
    - Balance of major classes of assets by nature and function
  - Intangible asset: next 5 years' amortization expense
  - with impairment test:
    - Impaired Asset description
    - Causing circumstance and events
    - fair value determination
    - amount of loss
    - position of impairment loss in income statement

### 2) Analyze and Interpret

- Estimate average age of firm assets
  - Reason to use: 
    - older, less efficient assets make firm less competitive
    - help to estimate future financing needs and capital expenditure timing
  - Calculation:
    - average age=accumulated depreciation/annual depreciation expense
      - more accurate for firms with SL method
    - total useful life=historical cost(not deduct AD)/annual depreciation expense
    - remaining useful life=ending net PPE(deducting AD)/annual depreciation expense
    - annual capital expenditure/annual depreciation expense ratio
      - check whether firm replacing asset at the same rate of depreciation.

### 3) Investment Property VS PPE

- Investment Property:
  - Definition: owned for <u>collecting rental income or earning appreciation</u>
  - IFRS: use *cost method or fair value* to do the valuation, firm generally use the same method for all investment property.
  - Cost method:
    - upward revaluation reported as *gain* on income statement.
