# Reading 23 Long-lived Assets

## 1. Capitalize VS Expensing

### 1) Comparison between Capitalized and Expensing Cost

- Capitalized interest:
  - Definition: firms construct an asset <u>for its own use or resale</u>, the interest accrues during construction period capitalized.
  - Goal: match the cost with revenue generation well
  - Reporting Position:
    - not in income statement as interest expense
    - interest cost is allocated to **income statement** through `depreciation expense`(own use) or `COGS`(resale)
    - on cash flow statement:
      - Capitalized Interest reported as *investing* outflow
      - While, Interest Expense reported as:
        - GAAP: *operating* outflow
        - IFRS: operating/investing/financing outflow
  - Ratio Analysis:
    - Any *depreciation* of capitalized interest should <u>add back</u> when calculating income measures.

### 2) Types of Intangible Assets

- Identifiable or Not? -->can be purchased separately or arise from contractual/legal right
- Not all intangible asset reported on balance sheet, which depends on its type or nature.
- Types:
  - Created Internally
    - R&D: 
      - under IFRS research cost-->expensing; development cost-->capitalize
      - under GAAP, both are expensing. 
        - The development cost can be capitalized until the <u>product technological feasibility established</u>.
  - Purchased
    - capitalize at cost(fair value at acquisition)
  - Obtained in Business Combination
    - identifiable assets and liabilities: capitalized at purchase price
    - goodwill: as non-identifiable assets capitalized on balance sheet

### 3) Capitalized & Expensing Costs Affect Ratios and FS

- Net Income
  - Capitalize expenditure *delays recognition of expense*-->Net income higher than Expensing
  - Subsequently, allocated to income statement as depreciation expense-->Net income lower than Expensing
  - Capitalizing <u>reduces variability</u> of net income.分期递减
  - Over the life of assets, <u>total net incomes are equal</u> using capitalization or expensing.
- Shareholder's Equity
  - Compared with Expensing, Capitalize
    - Retained earning higher, shareholder's equity higher, total asset higher
    - Subsequently, above items will be reduced.
- Cash Flow from Operations
  - Compared with Expensing, Capitalize
    - higher operating cash flow, lower investing cash flow, owing to classification difference
    - total cash flow will be the same
    - Subsequent deprecation expense allocation is *non-cash item* that has *no effect* on cash flow statement.
- Financial Ratios
  - Compared with Expensing, Capitalize
    - debt-to-asset ratio & debt-to-equity ratio lower
    - initially result in higher ROE and ROA, subsequently getting lower
    - interest coverage ratio(EBIT/interest expense):
      - measure firms ability to cover required interest payment on debt
      - lower interest expense, higher interest coverage ratio

## 2. Depreciation

### 1) Different Depreciation Methods for PPE

- Important Terms
  - carrying value
  - historical cost
- Types:
  - Straight line method
  - Accelerated depreciation 
    - double-declining balance(DDB)
  - Units-of-production method
- Component Depreciation

### 2) The Effects of Depreciation Methods and Useful Life & Residual Value Assumptions

### 3) Difference Amortization Methods for Intangible Assets

### 4) The Effects of Amortization Methods and Useful Life & Residual Value Assumptions

## 3. Impairment & Revaluation

### 1) Revaluation Model

### 2) Impairment of PPE and Intangible Assets

## 4. Fixed Asset Disclosure
