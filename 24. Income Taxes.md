# Reading 24 Income Taxes

## 1. Tax Terms

- Tax Return Terminology
  - taxable income: <u>income subject to tax</u> based on tax return
  - taxes payable: tax liability<--taxable income. Also called *current tax expense*
  - income tax paid: the *actual cash flow* for income taxes containing <u>payments and refunds</u> from other years.
  - tax loss carryforward: a *current or past loss* that can used to <u>reduce taxable income(tax payable)</u> in the future, causing `deferred tax assets`.
  - tax base: net amount of asset or liabilities used for reporting
- Financial Reporting Terminology
  - accounting profit: pretax income
  - üåüincome tax expense=taxes payable+$\Delta$DTL-$\Delta$DTA
  - deferred tax liabilities: excess of income tax expense over tax payable, causing future cash outflows.
  - deferred tax assets: excess of tax payable over income tax expense, can be recovered from *future operations* or *tax loss carryforward*.
  - valuation allowance: <u>DTA reduction</u> based on the likelihood the assets won't be realized.
  - carrying value: net balance sheet value of assets or liabilities.
  - permanent difference: difference between <u>taxable income</u> and <u>tax base</u> that will not reverse in the future.
  - temporary difference: difference between <u>tax base</u> and *carrying value* of asset or liability which will cause **taxable amounts** or **deductible amounts** in the future.
    - if it is <u>reserved</u> in the future, DTA & DTL will be created.

## 2. Deferred Tax Liabilities and Assets(DTL DTA)

### 1) Concepts

- The difference between tax reporting and financial reporting reasons:
  - financial statement adjustments may *not affect tax return* or be *recognized in difference period*.
  - tax losses from *prior period* will affect future taxable income
  - gain/loss recognition in income statement differs from <u>tax return</u>
  - asset/liability have different carrying amounts and tax bases.
  - revenue/expense recognized in income statement but never reported on tax return, Âèç‰πã‰æùÁÑ∂
  - expense/revenue recognition timings are different between income statement and tax return
- DTL
  - occurrence situation: income tax expense > tax payable
    - revenue/gains recognize on income statement before on tax return, due to temporary differences
    - expense/losses are <u>tax deductible</u> before they recognized in income statement
  - they are expected to *reverse* and causing *cash outflows* when taxes are paid.
  - often created when an <u>accelerated depreciation method</u> used on tax returns & <u>Straight-Line method</u> used on income statement.
  - Analytical purpose:
    - if they are reserved in the future-->classified as **liabilities**
    - if not expected to reserve in the future-->classified as **equity**
  - Net DTL=DTL-DTL
  - DTL=tax rate*(carrying value-tax base)
- DTA
  - occurrence situation: income tax expense < tax payable
    - revenue/gains are taxable before recognized on income statement
    - expense/losses are recognized on income statement before they are taxable
    - <u>tax loss carryforwards</u> are available to *reduce future* taxable income.
    - other causes: post-employment benefits, warranty expenses
      - warranty expenses are *not deductible for taxable income* until firm made actual expenditure to meet warranty claim. Timings are different.
  - they are expected to reverse by future operations and provide <u>future tax savings</u>.

### 2) Calculations

- Tax Base of Assets
  - Definition: the amount will be <u>deduced on tax return</u> in the future, as the economics benefits of assets are realized.ËµÑ‰∫ßÂèØ‰ª•Â∏¶Êù•ÁªèÊµéÊî∂Áõä‰∫Ü„ÄÇ
    - the difference between *carrying amount and tax base*
    - create DTL or DTA
  - Examples:
    - Depreciable Equipment
    - R&D
    - Account Receivable
- Tax Base of Liabilities
  - Definition: 
    - carrying value of liability - amounts that will be deductible on tax return in the future
    - tax base of revenue received in advance=carrying value -  the amount of revenue that will not be taxed in the future.
      - revenue received in advance is taxable when collected.
    - create DTL or DTA
  - Examples:
    - Customer Advance
    - Warranty Liabilities
    - Note Payable(No timing difference for both principle and interest payment)

## 3. Tax Rate Changes

### Effects on FS and Ratios

- DTL, DTA, income tax expenses are adjusted with changing of tax rate.
  - tax rate‚Üë(‚Üì), DTL & DTA‚Üë(‚Üì)
  - the effect on income tax expense:
    - $\Delta$ Income Tax Expense=Tax payable+ $\Delta$ DTL- $\Delta$ DTA
    - OR: can be calculated based on the difference between <u>tax base and carrying value</u> for an asset or liability
      - DTL=expected tax rate * the item mentioned above

## 4. Permanent Differences

### 1) Definition of Permanent Differences and Temporary Differences

- Permanent Differences
  - do not cause DTL or DTA
  - Causes:
    - revenue not taxable
      - eg: interest received on municipal bonds
    - expense not deductible
      - eg: cost life of insurance on key company officers
    - tax credits causing direct reduction of taxes
  - Effects:
    - firms' *effective tax rate*(derived from FS) differ from statutory tax rate.
      - effective tax rate=income tax expense/pretax income
      - alternative reason for this difference: firm operates in *more than one* tax jurisdiction.
- Temporary Differences
  - Causes:
    - DTL: investment in <u>another firm</u>(subsidiaries, affiliates, branches, joint venture) when *parents firm recognizes earnings* from the investment before dividends are received.
      - However, if the firm can control the timing of revenue recognition, or temporary differences will not reserve-->**No** DTL is reported.
    - DTA: investment causing *reservable* temporary differences, and <u>sufficient taxable profits</u> are expected.

### 2) Recognition and measurement of current and deferred tax items

- Measurement of deferred tax items
  - depends on the forced tax rate when temporary difference reserves.
  - acceptable tax rate depends on: how temporary difference will be settled.
  - whether a change in asset value is recorded on <u>income statement</u> or recorded to **equity** directly.
    - if taken to equity directly, without affecting **tax base** or **taxable income**-->DTL is not affected.-->*future tax liability* should be taken in *equity* as will.

### 3) Value Allowance for DTA

- DTL and DTA are carried on balance sheet at discounted present value
- DTA are access to BS date to determine the likelihood of <u>sufficient future taxable income</u> to recover the tax assets.
- When we need value allowance?
  - when the likelihood < 50%
  - some or all DTA will not be realized. That is, insufficient future taxable income to recover tax asset.
  - if company has **cumulative loss** over past few years, OR a history of *inability* to use tax loss carryforward-->value allowance is needed
- it is a *contra account* of DTA, decreasing taxable income, increasing income tax expense
  - value allowance‚Üì, net DTA‚Üë, earnings‚Üë-->an opportunity to manipulate earning
- Under IFRS, the account of value allowance is *not separately disclosed* but included in `DTA` account.
- value allowance‚Üì, net DTA‚Üë

### 4) Differences of Income Tax Accounting under IFRS and GAAP

- Revaluation of Fixed asset and Intangible asset
- Deferred Tax Asset Recognition
- Tax Rate used to Measure Deferred Tax
- **Undistributed profit** from investment in a joint venture/subsidiary

### 5) Deferred Item Disclosure

- The **source** of temporary difference should be disclosures in detail
  - difference depreciation methods used in financial reporting and tax reporting-->DTL
    - consider <u>company growth rate and capital spending levels</u> to determine the reverses.
  - Impairment-->DTA
- Other information of deferred tax:
  - DTA, DTL, value allowance, net change of value allowance over period
  - *unrecognized* DTL for undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or JV
  - income tax expense components
  - current year tax effect of each type of temporary difference
  - tax loss carryforwards and credits
  - <u>income tax expense</u> and tax expense based on *statutory* tax rate reconciliation
