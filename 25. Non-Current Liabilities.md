# Reading 25 Non-Current Liabilities

## 1. Bond Issuance

- Definition of Bonds
  - contractual promise
  - between bond issuer and bondholder
  - bond issuers should make payments over the period of bonds, including principle repayment at the end & periodic interest payment.
- Relationships between Terminology
  - Coupon payments=coupon rate * face value
    - face value also called `par value` or `maturity value`
  - Interest payment=book value of bond liability at the beginning of the period * market rate of the bond when issuance
    - effective rate of interest:
      - determined by *structure of interest rate, timing, bond's risk(default risk, liquidity risk)*
      - changes over time
      - is the market rate of interest required by bondholders, a kind of **present value** of future cash flows.
  - effective rate of interest($r_1$) VS coupon rate($r_2$):
    - if $r_1$ = $r_2$, par bond
    - if $r_1$ > $r_2$, discounted bond(priced below par)
    - if $r_1$ < $r_2$, premium bond(price above par)
- Par Bonds
  - par value=PV(face amount)+PV(coupon payments)
  - effects:
    - balance sheet: 
      - both asset & liabilities increase by face amount.
      - Book value(bond liability) fixed.
    - income statement: interest expenses=coupon payment
    - cash flow statement:
      - issue proceeds-->financing
      - coupon payment-->operating(under IFRS, also classified as **financing**)
      - principle repayment-->financing
- Premium or Discounted Bonds
  - yield != coupon rate;
  - PV (coupon received)+PV (face value) != par value
  - Discount bonds: investor pays < face value; the market price of bond=par value
  - premium bonds: investor pays more for above-market coupon payment
- Balance Sheet Measurement
  - Initially, both Asset & Liabilities ↑
    - book value(bond liability)=PV(remaining coupon payments)+PV(face value), where discount rate(r)=yield
  - for premium bonds, reported > face value. As premium amortized, book value(bond liability) ↓ until *reach face value* at maturity.
  - for discounted bonds, reported < face value. As discount amortized, book value(bond liability) ↑ until *reach face value* at maturity.
    - the purpose of discount amortization:
      - increase book value(bond liability) over time
      - increase interest expense
- Cash Flow Statement:
  - coupon interest are paid in cash
  - discount/premium amortizations are non-cash items
    - when presenting **operating** activities under **indirect** method, net income should <u>remove any related amortizations</u>.

## 2. Discount and Premium Bonds

- Effective interest rate method
  - Interest expense=book value of bond liability at the beginning of the period * bond's yield at issuance
  - for a premium bonds:
    - interest expense < coupon payment
    - the difference of above two: amortization of premium
    - bond liability @t=bond liability @(t-1) - amortization of premium
    - interest expense ↓ over time, bonds liability ↓
  - for a discount bonds:
    - interest expense > coupon payment
    - the difference of above two: amortization of discount
    - bond liability @t=bond liability @(t-1) + amortization of discount
    - interest expense ↑ over time, bonds liability ↑
  - Effective interest rate method is required under IFRS; While, for GAAP, this method is preferred, <u>straight-line method</u> is also allowed if the final results are not significantly different.
    - Straight-Line method: total discount/premium are amortized equal amount over periods
- Zero bonds
  - no periodical interest payments, pure-discount bonds
  - the actual interest payment is included in the face value which is paid at maturity.

## 3. Issuance Cost, De-recognition, Disclosures

- Issuance costs
  - Contents:
    - legal and accounting fees
    - printing costs
    - sales commissions...
  - Nature:
    - non-amortized cost
    - initial bond liability on balance sheet should <u>be deduct by issuance cost amount</u>, effective interest rate increases.
    - reported in cash flow statement as *financing activities*
    - *net against* bonds proceeds(inflow)
- Fair value reporting option
  - if bond yield changes, book value of bond liability != fair value(ie. economic liability)
    - bond yield ↑, fair value of bond liability ↓
  - GAAP&IFRS allow firms to report debt *at fair value*
    - any `gains and losses` result from bond market yield changes should be reported at income statement
      - gains: bond liability decrease
    - analysts prefer market value of debt than book value
      - eg: bond liability↓, equity ↑-->debt-to-asset & debt-to-equity ratios↓
- De-recognition of debt撤销，不承认
  - Redeem before Maturity Reasons
    - interest rate fallen不理解
    - firms have already generated enough cash through operations
    - funds from equity issuance
  - Financial Reporting
    - a gain/loss recognized at income statement, whose <u>amount=redemption price-book value of bond liability</u> at reacquisition date
    - if redeemed bonds' issuance cost capitalized, remaining *unamortized costs* should <u>written-off</u> and included in *gain/loss* as a part of continuous operations.
    - redeem debt not a part of day-to-day operations.
    - in cash flow statement, <u>redemption price</u> is reported as *financing activities outflow*, any gain(loss) should be **subtracted(added)** to net income when using indirect method for operating activities.
- Role of bonds contract(covenant) to protect creditors贷方
  - Bond Covenant Definition: 
    - restrictions for `borrowers` to protect lenders' position
    - reducing default risk and borrowing costs
  - Types of Restrictions:
    - Affirmative Covenants--borrower promise to do:
      - timely payments of principle and interest
      - maintain certain financial ratios
      - maintain collateral in working order担保附属品
    - Negative Covenants--borrower promise not to do some actions which have negative effects on ability to repay debt:
      - increasing dividend or repurchasing shares
      - issuing more debt
      - engaging M&A
  - bondholders can ask for immediate repayment of principle if <u>firm violates a covenant</u>.(technical default)
  - included in financial statement *footnotes*, providing information about valuing firm's equity and debt securities
- Financial statement presentation and related disclosures
  - firm reports all long-term liabilities in a single line on balance sheet
  - details will be disclosures in footnotes
    - liabilities nature
    - maturity dates
    - stated and effective interest rates
    - call provisions and conversion privileges调用规定和转换特权
    - restrictions imposed by creditors
    - asset pledged as security作为担保质押的资产
    - the amount of maturing debt in next five years

## 4. Lease and Pension Accounting

### 1) Motivation of Leasing Assets

- purchase the <u>right to use</u> of an asset from lessor in a specific period
- lessees make periodical payments to lessor
- the leasing assets contract content:
  - specific asset
  - give lessees all <u>economic benefits of the assets</u> during the term of lease
  - give lessees all *right to determine how to use the assets*
- Advantages over directly purchasing the assets
  - less initial cash flow, less costly financing($R_{lease}<R_{purchase}$), less risk of obsolescence废弃

### 2) Lessee's Financial Reporting

- Types of Lease:
  - Financial lease: both *benefit and risk of ownership* are transferred to lessees.
    - Criterions to judge whether it is a financial lease:
      - **ownership** of leased assets transferred to lessee
      - lessor has no right to use the asset.
      - the lessee has an option to *buy* the asset and *exercise* it买并使用
      - the lease is during most of asset's useful life使用时间
      - PV(lease payment)>=assets' fair value
  - Operating lease: either benefit or risk of ownership is transferred to lessees.
- Financial reporting requirements:
  - Under IFRS, Except short-term lease or small amount(<$5000), all leases required to report `right-of-use asset` and `lease liability` on balance sheet.
    - right-of-use asset: amortized over the period and the specific amount recorded on *income statement* using <u>straight line method</u>.
    - both of **right-of-use asset and lease liability** <u>begin with same value and reach 0 at the end</u>.
  - Under US GAAP, operating leases refer to <u>non-short-term</u> lease.
    - ending lease liability = book value of right-of-use asset
    - <u>straight line method</u> of book value of right-of-use asset *is not used*.
    - Income Statement: <u>interest expense and amortization of right-of-use asset</u> are combined and reported as `lease expense`, instead of reporting separately.
    - Cash Flow Statement: all lease payment classified as **operating** cash outflow.
  - Format: (Calculation logic is IFRS's)
    - 🌸year|beginning liability|interest expense|lease payment|principle repayment|ending lease liability|book value of right-of-use asset
    - principle repayment=lease payment-interest expense
    - ending lease liability=beginning liability-principle repayment
    - beginning liability @t=ending lease liability @(t-1)
    - book value of right-of-use asset=ending lease liability @$t_0$
    - book value of right-of-use usually amortized using **straight-line** method.
  - for *short-term or small amount lease* under IFRS, or *short term operating leases* under GAAP, they are not recorded any asset&liabilities on balance sheet, but included in income statement as `rental expense`.

### 3) Lessor's Financial Reporting

- Two Lease Types: financial or operating leases
  - **Financial Lease**s: Dr. leased assets; Cr. lease receivable
    - income statement:
      - if the expected lease payment != book value of asset-->the difference will be recorded as *gain/loss*
      - use `effective interest rate method` to amortize lease receivables
      - report *interest* portion of lease payment as *income*, which is included in lessor's revenue.
    - in cash flow statement, related cash inflow classified as *operating* activities.
  - **Operating Leases**
    - Balance Sheet:
      - lessor <u>doesn't move leased asset</u> from balance sheet
      - depreciation expenses are continued recording
    - Income Statement:
      - lease payment as **income**, depreciation or other costs related to leasing recorded as **expenses**.
    - Cash Flow Statement: the entire cash inflow classified as *operatin*g activities.

### 4) Defined Contribution & Defined Benefit Pension Plans Disclosure

- Pension: 
  - deferred compensation earned over time through employee service
  - Types:
    - Defined Contribution Plan
      - Definition: retirement plan that firms contributes a sum each period to employees' account
      - Factors: service years, employee ages, compensation, profitability, a percentage of employee's contribution
      - Risk Burden: 
        - firms make <u>no promise of Future Value</u> of the plan assets
        - employees burden all investment risk and do the investment decisions.
      - Financial reporting: 
        - pension expenses=employer's contribution
        - **no** future obligation needed to be reported as **liabilities**.
    - Defined Benefit Plan
      - Definition: firms make periodical payments to employees after retirements
      - Factors: employee service years, employees' compensation near retirement
      - Risk Burden: firm defines future value, *employer* assumes the investment risk.
      - Third party: trust helps firm to manage the plan asset to generate income and principle growth to pay pension benefits
      - Financial Reporting:
        - *net pension asset* or *net pension liability*
          - if fair value of plan assets > estimated pension liability-->overfunded-->`net pension asset` recorded on balance sheet
          - if fair value of plan assets < estimated pension liability-->underfunded-->`net pension liability` recorded on balance sheet
          - some classified in `net income`, some included in `OCI`(Equity)
        - future obligation forecasting variables:
          - future compensation levels
          - average retirement age
          - mortality rate
          - discount rate

### 5) Leverage and Coverage Ratios Calculation(Solvency)

- Leverage Ratios:
  - focus on balance sheet
  - measure amount of debt in firm's capital structure. 
  - Higher ratios, higher leverage.
  - Calculations:
    - Debt-to-Assets=total debt/total assets
    - Debt-to-Capital=total debt/(total debt+total equity)
      - Notes: ❗️except non-interest-bearing liabilities所以说前两个公式不完全相同.
    - Debt-to-Equity=total debt/total equity
    - Financial Leverage Ratio=average total assets/average total equity
- Coverage Ratios
  - focus on income statement
  - measure the *sufficiency of earnings to repay* interest and other charges
  - Calculations:
    - interest coverage=EBIT/interest payment
      - the lower, *higher difficulty* to meet interest repayment requirement
    - fixed charge coverage=(EBIT+lease payment)/(interest payments+lease payment)
      - this ratio is more meaningful for company who engages in <u>significant operating leases</u>.
