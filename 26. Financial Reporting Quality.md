# Reading 26 Financial Reporting Quality

## 1. Reporting Quality

### 1) Financial Reporting Quality VS Reported Result Quality

- Financial Reporting Quality
  - characteristic of a firm's financial statement
  - criterion: the adherence to GAAP in the jurisdiction裁决
  - if only compliance with GAAP != highest quality of financial reporting
  - High quality financial reporting: decision useful
    - characteristic: relevance & faithful representation
      - Relevance: be **useful** in decision making, be **material** in the information would affect users' decision making
      - faithful: completeness, neutrality, absence of errors
- Quality of Earnings
  - Criterion: `sustainability` of earnings/cash flow/balance sheet items & earning's <u>level</u>(ie. low enough in amount)
    - Evaluation of Sustainability: determine the proportion of reported earnings *will continue in the future*
      - reported earnings↑<-- changes in exchange rate, sales of assets which will not typically sustainable.
        - While, a <u>one-time</u> gain from favorable exchange rates changes which *will not be repeated*, having *small effect* on firm value valuation.没有持续性
      - profits↑<-- efficiency increases, market share increases
    - Impact of high earnings level:
      - sustain company existence and operation over time
      - provide *adequate return* to company investors
    - For balance sheet items: inadequate probable *liabilities* and overstatement of *asset values*--> reported earnings quality↓, a questioned sustainability
  - Effects:
    - one dollar of <u>high quality</u> earnings value added to company > one dollar of <u>low quality</u> earnings value added
    - P(high-quality earnings will continue in the future)↑ --> impact on the value of the firm
      - the impact calculation expression: PV(expected future earnings)
- There is an opportunity to find a firm with *high* financial reporting quality, but *low* quality of reported earnings.

### 2) Spectrum of Accessing Financial Reporting Quality

- Combine the two measurements mentioned above, we got a spectrum from best to worst.
- from best to worst:
  1. Reporting adherence to GAAP and decision useful; Earning are sustainable and adequate.
  2. Reporting adherence to GAAP and decision useful; Earning quality is low, reporting choices and estimates are biased.
  3. Reporting adherence to GAAP; The amount of earnings is actively managed to increase, decrease, smooth reported earnings
  4. Reporting not adherence to GAAP; The number presented are based on *actual economic activities*.
  5. Reporting not adherence to GAAP; The presented numbers are *fraudulent and fictitious*.

### 3) Conservation and Aggressive Accounting

- Goals: to <u>smooth earnings</u> over time, decrease earning *volatility* to avoid reducing *shares value*.
  - smooth earnings by *adjusting accrued liabilities*.
- Conservation
  - trend to decrease reported earnings or balance sheet items for current period
  - effect: increase earnings in future period
  - use cases: when higher-than-expected earnings, adjust accrued liabilities upward, allows deferral earnings recognition to future period.
  - financial statement disclosure: provide minimum disclosure, only <u>show the positive development</u>, ignore the negative ones.
  - Example:
    - expensing current period cost, shorter useful life estimation, lower salvage value estimation, accelerated depreciation method, early impairment recognition, more accrual reserve for bad debt, larger valuation allowance for DTA
  - standard verification: higher for <u>revenue and profit</u> than expenses and accrual liabilities
    - research cost expensing, associated revenue is not recognized
    - probable <u>legal liabilities accrual</u> are recorded
    - when future value probable *impaired*, *write down* inventory value. While under GAAP, related write-up is not allowed.
  - not ideal for FS users
- Aggressive
  - trend to increase reported earnings or balance sheet items for current period
  - effect: decrease in future earnings
  - use cases: when lower-than-expected earnings, adjust accrued liabilities downward
  - financial statement disclosure: present financial statement <u>transparently</u>
  - Example: opposite to above items
  - standard verification: higher for <u>expenses and accrual liabilities</u> than revenue and profit

### 4) Management Not Issues High Quality Financial Reports Motivations

- to meet or exceed a benchmark for EPS, mask poor performance
  - the benchmark will be:
    - earning guidance made by management perviously
    - consensus一致 analyst expectation
    - same period performance in prior years
- managers' career oriented: enhance reputation, improve future career opportunities, get incentive compensation depends on stock returns.
- gain investor's *credibility*, improving the *impression of company* by customers and suppliers.
- for highly leveraged and unprofitability companies, aggressive presentation helps <u>avoid violating debt covenants</u>.
- when earnings exceeds benchmark, managers use conservation presentations to move earnings in the future, to meet or beat benchmark in the future.

### 5) Conditions to Issue Low-Quality, Fraudulent Financial Reports

- Three factors that managers provide poor-quality financial reports:
  - motivation
  - opportunities
    - weak internal control
    - inadequate oversight of broad of directors
    - inconsequential penalities in case of accounting fraud because of loose accounting standards and treatments.
  - rationalization
    - less-than-ethical actions
    - management knows they do wrong action, but they tell stories that they seems to justify the problems.自我欺瞒，自我说服

### 6) Mechanisms of Financial Reporting Quality Discipline and Potential Limitation

- Market Regulatory Body for <u>trading securities and the market</u> they trade in
  - Examples:
    - US: SEC
    - UK: Financial Conduct Authority(FCA)
    - HK: Securities and Future Commission in Hong Kong
    - internationally:
      - International Organization of Securities Commissions(IOSCO)
      - EU: European Securities and Market Authority(ESMA)
  - Securities Regulations Requirement:
    - <u>Registration process</u> for new publicly traded securities issuance.
    - specific disclosure of periodical financial statement and notes.
    - an independent *auditor*
    - management prepares financial condition statement and management commentary
    - *Signed statement* for people who prepare FS
    - <u>Review process</u> for newly registered securities
  - Enforcement actions
    - fines
    - criminal prosecution of fraudulent
    - suspension of issuance or trading securities
    - public discloses the disciplinary proceeding result纪律处分程序
- Auditor:
  - require management to prepare assessment of <u>effectiveness of firm's internal control</u>.
  - an unqualified or clean audit opinion != no fraud, but offers *reasonable assurance* of *fair presented* FS.
  - the auditors <u>selected and paid</u> by the audited company
- Private Contracts

### 7) Detection: Effects of Presentation Choices

- Non-GAAP Measures Definition:
  - Goal: excluded some items to make <u>performance looks better</u> than defined or required by GAAP.
  - often classified as <u>one-time, non-operating costs, non-cash items</u> which will not affect operating earnings subsequently.
- The Firms Who Use Non-GAAP Measures:
  - display the *most comparable GAAP measures* with equal significance.
  - provide the *reasons and purposes* to use the specific non-GAAP measures
  - *reconcile the difference* between non-GAAP measures and most comparable GAAP measures.
  - declare whether the non-GAAP measures is likely to <u>recur in the future</u>

## 2. Accounting Choice and Estimates

- Revenue Recognition
  - timing:
    1. shipping process where customers actually takes title to the goods
    - free-on-broad(FOB) at shipping point(on firm's dock, revenue recognition **earlier** than another choice)
    - FOB at destination
    2. accelerating or delaying the shipment of goods
    - if additional revenue is required: overloading an channel with more goods than normal-->**Channel Stuffing**
      - firms offer discounts to increase order降价促销 in current period
      - ship goods to distributors without receiving an order未收到订单就发货
  - if high earnings is expected:
    - delay recognition of revenue to next period
    - delay customer shipment
  - in bill-and-hold transactions:
    - business model:
      - customers buy goods, receive an invoice发票
      - company keeps the goods at the location
    - effects:
      - increase earnings in current period(overstated, still in inventories), revenue for future period decreases to offset
- Estimates of Credit Losses
  - from `uncollectable customer credit accounts`
- Valuation Allowance
  - contra DTA account, decrease DTA on balance sheet, reduce net income
  - an allowance for bad debt, a contra account for bad debt, higher asset values
- Depreciation Methods and Estimates
  - salvage value, useful life, straight-line method, accelerate method
- Amortization and Impairment
  - goodwill is not amortized, but needs impairment.
    - by <u>ignoring or delaying impairment charge</u> for goodwill, management will increase earnings in current period.
- Inventory Methods
  - affect earnings and balance sheet value of inventory
  - considers from increasing/decreasing prices situation
  - FIFO more accurate inventory values on balance sheet; LIFO more accurate COGS; Weight-average cost more accurate Gross Profit in income statement, because of without inflation or deflation.
- Related-Party Transactions
  - transactions with other party <u>privately and controlled by management</u>
  - adjust price
  - *shift profit* to/from private company *to the earnings reported* by public company
- Capitalization
  - some expenses can be capitalized creates an asset, spreading the expense effects over many years.
  - affect cash flow classifications
    - expense is capitalized, classified as investing cash outflow-->operating cash flow↑
- Other Cash Flow Effects

## 3. Warning Signs and Manipulation Detection Method

- Revenue Recognition
  - revenue recognition methods changes
  - use bill-and-hold transactions
  - barter transactions物物交换
  - require estimation of rebates打折扣 impact on net income
  - lack of transparency about how various components of a customer order are recorded as revenue
  - *revenue growth* excess with peers
  - *receivable turnover* decreasing continuously
  - *total asset turnover* decreases when company is growing by acquisition
  - include <u>non-operating items or one-time sales</u> in revenue
- Inventories
  - inventory turnover ratio ↓
  - LIFO liquidations
- Capitalization Policies
  - firm capitalizes costs which are not typically capitalized by other company in same industry
- Relationship between Revenue and Cash Flow
  - operating cash flow/net income ratio is declining and <1 over periods.
- Other
  - depreciation method and estimation are significantly different from others in the same industry
  - quarterly earnings show a pattern compared to seasonality of earnings in industries or the firm
  - significant transactions with related parties
  - expense classified as *nonrecurring but appear regularly* in FS
  - *gross/operating profit margins* are significantly higher than peers
  - management only provides *minimal* financial reporting *disclosure*
  - emphasize non-GAAP earnings measures, uses special, nonrecurring aggressively
  - growth by purchasing large amount of business gives company opportunities to *manipulate asset values*, and depreciation or amortization.
