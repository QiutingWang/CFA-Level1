# Reading 27 Applications of Financial Statement Analysis

## 1. Forecasting

### 1) Evaluate Past Financial Performance and Company Strategy

- *Trends* of financial ratios & *difference* between firm's and competitors average level in the same industry reflect firm's <u>business strategy</u>.
  - eg: premium products usually *gross margins* > that of less differentiated commodity-like products
    - COGS, later is higher than the premium products
    - premium products may spend large proportion of cost in <u>S&D or advertising</u>
  - if company wants to *improve EPS by cutting cost*, we can check the <u>operating profit margin and gross profit margin</u> to show the actual facts.

### 2) Forecast Company Future Net Income and Cash Flow

- Begin with forecasting **future sales**
  - shorter horizon, `top-down` approach can be use.
    - Begin with GDP从宏观层面开始, use the historical relationship between GDP growth and industry sales growth.
      - Also take firm's <u>market share</u> into consideration
- In simple model, *Historical average* or *Trend-adjusted* measure of ratios(eg: operating margin, gross profit margin, EBT margin...) can be used to forecast earnings.
- In complex model, each items on balance sheet, income statement's growth rate can be estimated based on the historical relationship with *revenue growth*.
- For *multi-period forecasting*, analyst uses *a single estimate* of sales growth at some point which can be continue indefinitely.
- Estimating cash flows, make assumption of <u>source and use</u> of cash.
  - key factors: increase in working capital, capital expenditure on new fixed assets, debt issuance or repayment, stock issuance or repurchasing.
  - key assumption: ratio of non-working capital/sales fixed
  - indicate *the need of cash* in future, met by projecting necessary borrowing in future period

## 2. Credit and Equity Analysis

### 1) The Role of FS Analysis in Accessing Credit Quality of Potential Debt Investment

- Three Cs:
  - Character: management professional reputation & firm history of debt repayment
  - Collateral附属担保品: reduce lender risk
  - Capacity to repay: requires close examination of FS and ratios. Long-run review for firm's long-term debt.
- 4 Types of Credits Rating Formulas:
  - Scale and diversification: larger companies have wide variety of product lines and greater geographical diversification with better credit rating
  - Operational efficiency: high operating ROA, operating profit margin, EBITDA margins, high credit rating.
  - Margin stability: higher earning margin stability, higher probability to make repayment.
  - Leverage: 
    - Components: ratios of EBITDA,operating earnings, FCF to interest expense or total debt
    - the higher the ratios, the better credit rating.

### 2) FS Analysis and Screening Potential Equity Investment

- Use FS ratios and account items to measure the performance of selected value, income, growth stocks.
- <u>Multiple criterions</u> should be used.
- Equity screens should *include or exclude many other or all firms* in the specific industry, avoiding bias and industry intrinsic nature.
- Backtesting: 
  - using specific set of criteria to screen *historical data* to show how the selected portfolio perform.
  - no promise for the **continuing** outperformance based on specific criterion.
  - bias: data-mining, look-ahead, survivorship

### 3) Proper Analyst FS Adjustment for Comparison with Peers

- Reasons of Adjustment:
  - Different companies choose different accounting methods, local accounting standards, estimations
- Main Adjustment Areas:
  - Investing in Securities: different in classification
    - unrealized gain and losses on hold-on-sale-->income
    - unrealized gain and losses on available-for-sale or held-to-maturity-->balance sheet asset value.
  - Inventory Accounting Differences
    - Adjust LIFO(only allowed under GAAP) to FIFO
  - Depreciation Method and Estimation(useful life & salvage values) Differences
    - adjustment between aggressive or conservation expression on *net income and fixed asset accounts*.
    - use items: average age of firms' asset, average useful life, average remaining useful life.
    - <u>upward revaluation</u> is not allowed under GAAP, but allowed under IFRS. An adjustment should be conducted in income statement.
  - Goodwill
    - goodwill should be subtracted from assets when calculating financial ratios
      - eg: *remove goodwill* from assets to calculate <u>price to book value of equity per share</u> 
    - reverse any goodwill impairment loss, reported net income increases.
