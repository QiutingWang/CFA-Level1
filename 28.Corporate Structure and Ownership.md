## 3. Company Claims and Lender/Owners Motivations

- Lenders: legal and contractual claims to interest and principle payments
- Owners: have a residual claim to company net assets, that is, the remaining after all other claims paid
- lenders' claim has *higher priority* than owner's
- Both of the two will lose entire investment when company fails, the <u>losing amount<=investment amounts</u>.
- Difference between debt(interest+principle repayment) and equity investment(unlimited): **upside potential**
- Interest Conflicts:
  - debt holders: more care about the company's ability to repay the liabilities, less pay attention to firms' potential growth.(smaller risky level is preferred)
