# Reading 31 Capital Investments

## 1. Capital Allocation Principles

### 1) Types of Capital Investments

- Business Maintenance Investment
  - Going-Concern Projects
    - effect: maintain business and cut costs, improve efficiency by checking an asset conditions
    - normally made without detailed analysis
    - Decision Making: whether the existing operations or procedures/process should continue
  - Regulatory/Compliance Projects
    - required by governmental agency or insurance company
    - involved safety-related or environmental concerns
    - generate little revenue
- Business Growth Investment
  - Expansion Projects
    - complex decision-making process and detailed analysis are needed
    - requires future demand forecasting
  - Other increase Size and Scope of a Company: eg: new investments outside the company's existing lines of business

### 2) Capital Allocation Process & Principle

- The Importance of Capital Allocation
  - identify and evaluate capital projects which have cash flows more than one year, impacting future earnings
  - content include: buy a new machine, expand business to another geography area, move the headquarter, replace an asset
  - it is the major working content of financial manager
  - related to other corporate decisions: working capital management, strategy M&A
- 4 Administrative Process
  - Idea generation: can from multiple sources: senior management, functional division, employees
  - Project Proposal Analysis: reject/accept based on *expected future cash flows* to determine future profitability
  - Firm-Wide Capital Budget: prioritize profitable projects by <u>timing of cash flows, company available resources, overall strategy plan</u>
  - Decision Monitoring and Post-Audit Conduction:
    - check whether projections match actual performance
    - identify *systematic errors* in forecasting period
- Principles
  - Decisions based on <u>cash flows</u>, not accounting income: care about `incremental cash flows`
  - Cash flows are based on *opportunity costs*: OC should be included in project costs, 
  - **Timing** of cash flows is important: care about *time value of money*, cash flow received earlier are worth than that received later.
  - Cash flows are analyzed on an <u>after-tax basis</u>: focus on the cash flows get to keep forward
  - Financial costs are reflected in projected *required rate of return*:
    - when estimating incremental cash flows, *financial costs* are not included. While, *discount rate* taken as cost of capital.
    - ❗️only projects expected to return more than cost of capital-->accept.
  - Other Terms:
    - Sunk cost: which cannot be avoided, even if the project is not undertaken, excluded from analysis
    - Externalities:
      - Definition: the effect of acceptance a project may have on *other* firm cash flow*.
      - **Cannibalization**自相蚕食:
        - negative externalities effect
        - when a project takes sales from an existing product. This **loss** should taken in consideration.
        - eg: soft drink company introduces a diet version of an existing beverage饮料.
      - Positive externalities effect
    - Cash flow patterns
      - conventional: if the sign on CF changes **once**, >=1 CF outflows followed by >=1 CF inflows
      - unconventional: has >1 sign changes
    - Multiple Project Selections:
      - Independent projects(&&)
      - Mutually Exclusive(||): selection decision made by profitability ranking
    - **Real options**: the opportunity to undertake second project depends on the outcome of the first one.
      - the value of real options实物期权 should be included in NPV calculation.
      - it doesn't have negative values
      - involving a tangible asset, but not a financial instrument
    - Capital rationing: with constraints on amount of capital, <u>maximum increase of shareholders' value</u> with limited amount of capital expenditure.

## 2. NPV and IRR

### 1) NPV IRR Calculation

- NPV
  - Definition: Sum of PV of all expected incremental cash flows if the project is undertaken
  - discount rate=cost of capital, adjusted for risk level
  - initial cash outflows followed by series of expected *after-tax* cash inflows
  - Functions: $NPV=CF_0+\frac{CF_1}{(1+k)}+\frac{CF_2}{(1+k)^2}+...\frac{CF_n}{(1+k)^n}=\sum_{t=0}^n \frac{CF_t}{(1+k)^t}$
    - $CF_0$: negative cash flow, initial investment
    - $CF_t$: negative or positive
    - $k$: required rate of return
  - Accept or not? --> NPV>0
- IRR
  - Definition: the discount rate that makes PV of expected incremental after-tax cash inflows==initial cash outflows
  - $PV(inflows)=PV(outflows)$-->$NPV=0=CF_0+\frac{CF_1}{(1+IRR)}+\frac{CF_2}{(1+IRR)^2}+...\frac{CF_n}{(1+IRR)^n}=\sum_{t=0}^n \frac{CF_t}{(1+IRR)^t}$
  - Function:$0=NPV=$
  - Decision rule: if IRR>required rate of return, accept it, this IRR also called **Hurdle Rate**

### 2)Advantages and Disadvantage

- NPV
  - Advantages: directly measure the expected increase in the firm's value
  - Disadvantage: do not include the <u>size of project</u>
- IRR
  - Advantage:
    - measure profitability as percentage
    - provide margin of safety
  - Disadvantages
    - the possibility of producing <u>rankings of mutually exclusion projects</u> different from NPV
    - there exists a possibility that project has <u>multiple IRR or 0 IRR</u>.

## 3. Capital Allocation Pitfalls & Real Options

### 1) Common Pitfalls

- fail to incorporate economic response into analysis: in some industry, investment in the projects with low barrier to entry, increasing future competition
- misusing standardized templates, results in estimation error.
- pet projects of senior management: influential senior management members contain <u>overly optimistic</u> projections on making the project *seems to be more profitable* than it really is.
- investment decision based on EPS or ROE: managers whose compensations related to EPS or ROE may avoid positive long-term NPV investments.
- using IRR criterion for project decisions: if one project has high IRR but low NPV. NPV is more accurately reflect the goal of maximizing shareholders' value. We should use **NPV criterion**.
- poor cash flow estimation: effect of <u>inflation</u>; double count or fail to include certain cash flows.
- misestimate overhead costs: only overhead costs related to <u>time management and IT support</u> should be included. Overhead costs are difficult to estimate properly.
- use incorrect discount rate: required rate of return adjusted risk should be used. WACC can not be used directly.
- politics involved with spending entire capital budget: some managers spend all capital budget each year and ask for extra budget amount for the following year.
- failure to generate alternative investment ideas: whether there *exists a better idea* than the existing one.
- handle sunk or opportunity costs improperly: 
  - should not consider *sunk cost* cuz of not influent by investment decision making;
  - <u>opportunity costs</u> should be taken into consideration

### 2) Expected Relationship among Investment, Company Value, Share Prices

- Whether company creates value for shareholders?
  - Compare Return on company's Investment in Assets to Cost of Capital
  - Formula: Return on Invested Capital(ROIC)=Net Operating Profit after Tax(NOPAT)/average book value of total capital=after-tax net profit/average book value of total capital
    - after-tax net profit=net income+after-tax interest expense
    - NOPAT should subtract `after-tax non-operating income`
    - denominator: includes debt, common stock, preferred stock
  - Criterion: if **ROIC > WACC**-->company's management increases firm's value
  - NPV is related to share value, positive NPV project causes a <u>proportionate increase in firm's stock price</u>.

### 3) Types of Real Options

- Timing: allow company to <u>delay making an investment</u> for having *better information* in the future.
- Abandonment: 
  - allow company to abandon project if PV of incremental CF from *existing a project*>>PV of incremental CF from *continuing the project*
  - similar to put options: sell an asset at given price in the future
- Expansion: 
  - allow companies to *make additional investment* in future projects if company decides they will create value
  - similar to call options: buy an asset at given price in the future 
- Flexibility
  - price setting: allow company to change the price of a product
    - eg: increase product price if the demand is high, for gaining more without increasing production.
  - production flexibility: pay workers overtime, using different materials as input, produce different variety of product
- Fundamental: projects that are options themselves, because the payoffs depend on <u>the price of an underlying asset</u>
