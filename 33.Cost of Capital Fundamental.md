# Reading 33 Cost of Capital Fundamental

## 1. Weighted Average Cost of Capital(WACC)

### 1) WACC Calculation and Taxation Effects

- capital component: debt, preferred equity, common equity
- WACC also called Marginal Cost of Capital
- $WACC=w_d[k_d(1-t)]+w_{ps}k_{ps}+w_{ce}k_{ce}$
  - $w_d$: percentage of debt in capital structure
  - $w_{ps}$: percentage of preferred stock in capital structure
  - $w_{ce}$: percentage of common stock in capital structure
  - $k_d$: rate at company issuing new debt, before-tax
  - $k_{ce}$: cost of common equity, *required rate of return* on common stock which is difficult to estimate.
- Financing department: responsible for keeping costs low and using a balance of equity or debt source to reach target weights in long run.
- When ROA>Required Rate of Return on Capital Needed to Fund Assets→company creates value
- it can be viewed as *Opportunity Cost*. It reflects <u>the average risk of projects</u>, not appropriate for evaluating all new project.
  - WACC *adjusted upward* for project with *greater*-than-average risk

### 2) Cost of Debt Capital Calculation

- After-tax cost of debt=$k_d(1-t)$
- Cost of debt==market interest rate(YTM) on new debt != coupon rate on existing debt
- Some Situations:
  - tax adjustment when interest payment is not allowed to tax deduct, $t=0$.
  - when interest payment is *tax deductible*, for the amount <u>in excess of the maximum amount</u>, the appropriate cost of debt is <u>pretax debt</u>.
  - if market YTM is not available, owing to firm's debt is not public traded: analyst should use <u>rating & existing debt's maturity</u> to estimate the before-tax cost of debt.
    - this method called **matrix pricing** or <u>valuing bond based on yields of comparable bonds</u>
  - company employs <u>floating-rate debt</u>, analyst should estimate <u>long-term cost of firm's debt</u> using *current yield curve* with proper rating category.

### 3) Cost of Noncallable, Nonconvertible Preferred Stock Calculation

- $k_{ps}=D_{ps}/P$
  - $D_{ps}$: preferred dividends per share
  - $P$: market price of preferred

### 4) Cost of Equity Capital Calculation

- Capital Asset Pricing Model Approach(CAPM)
  - $k_{ce}=R_f+\beta [E(R_{mkt})-R_f]$
    - $R_f$: yields on default risk-free debt, usually we use <u>treasury notes</u>, we can choose one close to the *useful life of project*.
    - $\beta$: stock systematic risk measure
- Bond Yield + Risk Premium Approach
  - $k_{ce}=bond \space yield+risk \space premium$
    - the normal range of risk premium $\in [3\%,5\%]$
- 2 methods will give us different result of $k_{ce}$.

## 2. Beta Estimation and Flotation Costs

### 1) Beta Estimation

- For public traded stock, beta determinants:
  - the choice of proxy for overall market portfolio
  - the length of period selected
  - time period for individual returns
    - *60 observations of monthly returns* are used.
  - Adjusted beta=2/3 raw beta + 1/3
- For stock infrequently traded or not publicly traded:
  - estimate beta from returns on a <u>comparable stock</u>in the same industry or with similar business risks actively traded.
  - if we choose stocks with *similar business risks* as peers to compare:
    - individual betas will be different because of <u>use of financial leverage or tax rates</u>
    - solution:
      - use the *beta of conglomerate*(多种经营的)联合大企业 in the same business is inappropriate, owing to there are <u>many lines of businesses</u>.
  - Determinate:
    - risk of different lines of business
    - financial structure:
      - the greater reliance on <u>debt financing</u>, the *higher* equity beta
  - ❗️Formula: 
    - get *un-leveraged beta or asset beta* of comparable company:
      - $\beta_{Asset}=\beta_{Equity}(\frac{1}{1+[(1-t)\frac{D}{E}]})$
        - $\frac{D}{E}$: debt-to-equity ratio of **comparable** company
    - get equity unadjusted beta for target company
      - $\beta_{Target}=\beta_{Asset}(1+[(1-t) \frac{D}{E}])$
        - $\frac{D}{E}$: debt-to-equity ratio of **target** company，使用的t也是对应公司的
    - Notes: if we use *group of peer* companies, the procedures are the same, but we need to <u>take average</u> when calculating unlevered beta of comparable company.

### 2) Correct Treatment of Floatation Costs

- Floatation costs发行成本
  - Definition:
    - fee charged by IBD when companies *raise external equity capital*.
    - the amounts are usually $\in [2\%,7\%]$ of total raising amount, which depends on type of offering.
  - Calculation: put floatation costs into <u>cost of capital</u> by increasing cost of external equity
    - $k_e=\frac{D(1+g)}{P(1-f)}+g$
      - $g$: growth rate of firm dividend for foreseeable future
      - $f$: floatation costs
  - helps up to understanding the impact of raising funds
