# Reading 33 Cost of Capital Fundamental

## 1. Weighted Average Cost of Capital(WACC)

### 1) WACC Calculation and Taxation Effects

- capital component: debt, preferred equity, common equity
- WACC also called Marginal Cost of Capital
- $WACC=w_d[k_d(1-t)]+w_{ps}k_{ps}+w_{ce}k_{ce}$
  - $w_d$: percentage of debt in capital structure
  - $w_{ps}$: percentage of preferred stock in capital structure
  - $w_{ce}$: percentage of common stock in capital structure
  - $k_d$: rate at company issuing new debt, before-tax
  - $k_{ce}$: cost of common equity, *required rate of return* on common stock which is difficult to estimate.
- Financing department: responsible for keeping costs low and using a balance of equity or debt source to reach target weights in long run.
- When ROA>Required Rate of Return on Capital Needed to Fund Assetsâ†’company creates value
- it can be viewed as *Opportunity Cost*. It reflects <u>the average risk of projects</u>, not appropriate for evaluating all new project.
  - WACC *adjusted upward* for project with *greater*-than-average risk

### 2) Cost of Debt Capital Calculation

- After-tax cost of debt=$k_d(1-t)$
- Cost of debt==market interest rate(YTM) on new debt != coupon rate on existing debt
- tax adjustment on interest payment is not allowed, not tax deductible.

### 3) Cost of Noncallable, Nonconvertible Preferred Stock Calculation

- $k_{ps}=D_{ps}/P$
  - $D_{ps}$: preferred dividends per share
  - $P$: market price of preferred

### 4) Cost of Equity Capital Calculation

- Capital Asset Pricing Model Approach
  - $k_{ce}=R_f+\beta [E(R_{mkt})-R_f]$
- Bond Yield + Risk Premium Approach
  - $k_{ce}=bond \space yield+risk \space premium$
