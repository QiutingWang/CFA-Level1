# Reading 34 Capital Structure

- The proportion of debt or equity financing.
- trade off between tax saving and additional risk of increased financial leverage

## 1. Theories

### 1) Factors Affect Capital Structure

- Definition of Capital Structure:
  - how it finance assets and operations
  - with minimum WACC given selected proportion of debt and equity
  - can be reflected by <u>debt-to-equity ratio</u> presented with *market value*, not accounting book value.
  - almost similar in the same industry
- Internal Factors
  - industry or company characteristic: sometimes their <u>exists conflict</u> in supporting debt financing
    - revenue & cash flows稳定性、可预测性
      - companies in <u>non-cyclical industries</u> are better able to *support high proportion of debt* than which in cyclical industries.
      - with <u>low fixed operating costs</u> as a proportion of total cost......with high fixed costs
      - with <u>subscription-based revenue</u>......with *pay-per-use* revenue model
    - type of assets company used to generate revenue
      - <u>tangible asset</u> can be treated as *collateral* better than intangible assets
      - ...can be *sold for cash* without losing significant value ....(more liquid)
      - ...can more easily to *find substitute* by similar assets...
      - firms <u>own their productive assets outright</u> have *more collateral* than using assets owned by others资产所有权
  - existing debt level
    - analysts use financial ratios to estimate <u>debt capacity ans usage</u>
      - eg: higher current ratio, higher profitability ratio
      - *leverage and coverage ratios* for estimating debt capacity
        - warning signs:
          - debt-to-EBITDA>3
          - interest coverage ratio<2
  - corporate tax rate
    - in countries where <u>debt interests are tax deductible</u>, encouraging *higher* proportion of debt
  - management preference
    - company own policy based on <u>covenants of existing debt</u> or <u>debt rating agency threshold</u> with safety margin
      - Debt rating:
        - reflect *probability of default* on company debt
        - lower debt rating indicates *higher risk* for debt- or equity-holders who require *higher expected return*.
        - lower debt rating gives firm a <u>flexibility to issue additional debt</u> after identifying attractive investment opportunities.
        - affects <u>cost of capital</u>. Hence, managers maintain a minimum debt rating, which place a limitation on borrowing. Lower debt rating, higher cost of debt.
    - management would include <u>published index</u> in debt or equity securities.
      - The index providers have minimum requirements, such as *market cap for equity or issue size for debt*, influencing company's capital structure.
- External Factors
  - market and business cycle conditions
    - when market interest rate↓ OR company credit spread above a benchmark rate↓→firm prefers to <u>issue debt</u> for expansion
  - regulation
    - eg: in some countries, financial institution should keep a <u>minimum proportion of equity</u>-->restrict ability to issue debt or pay cash dividend
  - industry norms: factors affect companies in the same industry will *be similar and fall in a specific range* viewed as normal.

### 2) How it Change Over Life Cycle

- The Influence of Company Characteristics on Debt Proportion
  - growth and stability of revenue
  - growth and predictability of cash flow
  - amount of business risk
  - asset amount and liquidity: more liquid, debts are more attractive.
  - debt financing cost and availability: lower cost of debt, more attractive to investors.
- D/E in Different Stages of Life Cycle
  - start-up
    - Characteristic:
      - sales begin, operating earnings and cash flows low or negative, high business risk;
      - assets(log-term & short-term) are low, for collateral not available-->liquidity low
    - company debt is risky, required high interest rate.
    - start-up companies almost **exclusively depend on equity**.
  - growth
    - sales and cash flow ↑, business risk↓
    - debt financing cost reduced, investors willing to lend to this company with enough amount of collateral assets
    - debt issuance makes up for 20% of firm's capital structure.
  - mature
    - revenue growth slowing down, lower business risk, stable and significant cash flows, debt financing cost is low
    - debt makes up for **>20%** of firm's capital structure.
    - over time, as equity value↑, debt proportion↓
    - some companies <u>repurchase debt</u>, deleveraging and paying significant dividends.

### 3) Modigliani-Miller Propositions

- MM1 Propositions(no tax): Firm Value & Capital Structure Irrelevance
  - Assumptions:
    - perfectly competitive capital markets without transaction/taxes/bankruptcy costs
    - investors have homogeneous expectations about the CF generated by firm
    - riskless borrowing and lending at $R_f$ for investors
    - no agency costs: <u>no conflicts of interest</u> between managers and shareholders
    - investment decisions(operating income) are not affected by <u>financing decisions</u>
  - Definition:
    - as a pie
    - ❗️value of the firm(size of pie) doesn't depend on *capital structure*(section proportion of pie) or on <u>how claims to its earnings are divided</u>.
      - value of firm: discounted PV of these earnings
        - discount rate: depends on *risk of earnings*
  - Formula: $V_L=V_U$
- MM2 Propositions(no taxes): Cost of Equity and Leverage
  - Content:
    - cost of equity increases linearly as company <u>increases its proportion of debt financing</u>.
      - because <u>greater amount of debt</u> in capital structure, *more uncertain are residual cash flows* to equity holders.
    - cash flows promise debtholders less risky than shareholders→cost of debt < cost of equity资金流先满足于repay债务，剩余资金流给shareholder
    - <u>decrease financing costs</u> using larger proportion of debt is offset by *cost of equity* increasing→WACC unchanged
  - Formula: $r_e=r_0+\frac{D}{E}(r_0-r_d)$
    - $r_0$: cost of equity with 0 debt
    - $\frac{D}{E}$:leverage ratio
  - Graph:
    - X-axis: D/E
    - Y-axis: Cost of Capital
    - $WACC> r_d$: both are straight horizontal lines with fixed values.
    - $r_e$ formula is shown in the graph with interception $r_0$, slope $(r_0-r_d)$
- MM1 with Taxes: Value is Maximized at 100% Debt
  - Additional assumptions about Taxation:
    - earnings are taxed
    - debt interest payments are *tax deductible*
      - **tax shield**, adding value to company
        - Calculation: amount of tax shield = tax rate × amount of debt in capital structure
        - value of levered firm=value of unlevered firm+value of tax shield by debt financing
    - dividend paid is not tax deductible.
  - Formula: 
    - $r_e=r_0+\frac{D}{E}(r_0-r_d)(1-T_c)$
    - $V_L=V_U+t*D$
  - Graph
    - WACC ↓ as leverage ↑
    - when WACC is minimized, firm's value reaches at maximum
  - In reality, we cannot find a company whose capital structure is 100% debt, considering the additional costs of using debt financing: **Costs of Financial Distress**财务危机成本
    - Definition:
      - increased costs when earning decreasing to the point where firm has trouble <u>paying its fixed financing costs</u>.
    - Components:
      - financial distress or bankruptcy costs can be direct or indirect
        - direct: legal fees, administrative fees
        - indirect:
          - foregone investment opportunities过去的投资机会
          - costs of losing customers, suppliers, creditors, employees
          - agency costs of debt(conflict of interests)
      - probability of financial distress related to <u>operating or financing leverage</u> & quality of management and corporate governance structure.
    - Influence: <u>higher expected costs of financial distress</u>, *discouraging* to use large proportion of debt.
- Static Trade-Off Theory
  - Definition:
    - balance *financial distress costs* and debt financing *tax shield* benefits
    - Optimal point: minimum WACC, maximum firm value, point @increase in tax shield benefits from additional borrowing>>expected costs of financial distress
  - Formula for Levered Firm: $V_L=V_U+(t*Debt)-PV(financial \space distress \space costs)$
  - Graph:
    - Cost of Capital VS Capital Structure(% debt)
      - Curve of WACC: concave shape
      - Curve of Cost of equity // After-tax cost of debt with financial distress
    - Firm Value(y) VS Capital Structure(x)
      - value of levered firm: convex shape-->the optimal point can be found at peak
      - PV(tax shield)=Firm market Value - Value of unlevered firm
      - PV(financial distress)=Firm market value-value of levered firm
      - value of levered firm: horizontal straight line

## 2. Decisions

### 1) Target Capital Structure Weights

- Target Capital Structure
  - Definition: a firm seeks to achieve on average over time to maximum firm value-->belief of optimal capital structure
- actual capital structure <u>fluctuate around</u> target one
  - reasons:
    - market value of firm's equity & debt fluctuate
    - management chooses to exploit开发 specific financing source opportunities
      - eg: 公司股价突然升高，公司issue new shares-->actual equity proportion>target one
- when estimating WACC, the weights are used from <u>target capital structure</u>.
  - While, some companies don't provide information about self target capital structure. Analyst should estimate it using:
    - simply use firm *current* capital structure based on *market value*
    - identify the <u>notable trend</u> of firm capital structure
    - use industry average weights
- Cost of Asymmetric Information
  - managers have more information than creditors or owners
  - firm with <u>complex produce or little transparency in FS</u>, cost of Asymmetric Information↑, leading to higher required return of debt and equity
  - solution: investors analyze <u>behavior of management</u> to forecast the future performance of firm.
- Net Agency Cost of Equity
  - interest conflict between owners and mgt
  - Components:
    - monitoring costs: related to supervised management
      - eg: report to shareholders expense, pay broad of director expense
      - strong corporate governance reduce this costs.
    - bonding costs
      - related to ensuring shareholders that managers are working for shareholders' interest
      - eg: non-compete agreements, insurance to guarantee performance premium
    - residual losses
  - Solution: greater amount of leverage, reduce the remaining cash flow for managers' own benefits.
- Pecking Order Theory
  1. internal generated capital is most preferred
  2. debt
  3. external equity is less preferred
  - capital structure is the by-product of individual financing decisions.

### 2) Stakeholders Interests

- Public Debtholders
  - debtholders prefer companies issue less debt for ensuring existing loans repayment at time and avoiding financial distress costs
  - stockholders prefer companies issue more debt for increasing firm's risk
  - the interest conflicts between long-term and short-term bondholders are less severe
- Preferred Stockholders
  - priority: bond>preferred stock>common stock dividend
  - interest conflicts between preferred stock & common stock holders are similar to bondholders & shareholders
  - preferred stock has no maturity date with timely <u>payment of promised dividend</u>. (Can be treated as long-term debt in this case)
- PE or Controlling Shareholders
  - conflict: who hold voting control
  - short-term focus VS long-term focus为了套现过早卖出股票，导致他们失去长期公司控制权
- Banks and Private Lenders
  - private lenders usually <u>hold debt to maturity</u>, while public debt owners can sell it flexibly.
  - 🌟bank and private lenders work closely with company, ensuring their interests are considered in management decisions.
- Customers and Suppliers利益一致
  - suppliers have significant interests in customer's firm stability
  - customers of specialized products care about <u>financial health and survival of firms</u>
- Employees
  - **employees with specialized skill**s prefer firm with <u>less financial and operational risk</u>
  - while **employees have transferable skill** are not
- Managers & Directors
  - managers prefer stock repurchasing, number of outstanding shares↓, share prices↑←**issue debt** for raising money for repurchasing
- Regulators & Government
  - financial crisis: government require firms to raise more equity prior to dividend payment and repurchases,以达到最低equity proportion的标准
