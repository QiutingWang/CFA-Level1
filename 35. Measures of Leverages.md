# Reading 35 Measures of Leverages

## 1. Terminology

- leverage
  - Definition: refer to amount of *fixed costs* a firm has
    - fixed costs
      - fixed operating expense: building or equipment leases
      - fixed financing costs: interest payment on debt
  - effect: higher leverage, more <u>variability</u> of <u>after-tax operating earnings and net income</u>
    - if company employs operating leverage, given $\Delta Sales \rightarrow$ greater $\Delta OperatingEarnings$
    - if company employs financial leverage, given $\Delta OperatingEarnings \rightarrow$ greater $\Delta NetIncome$
- business risk
  - Definition: 
    - risk related to operating income
    - result from *uncertainty* of revenue and expenses necessary to produce revenues
  - Components:
    - sales risk: uncertainty about firm sales
    - operating risk: additional uncertainty about operating income caused by <u>fixed operating costs</u>
      - proportion of fixed operating costs to variable costs$\uparrow$, operating risk$\uparrow$
- financial risk
  - Definition: the additional risk that *common shareholders* must bear when using fixed costs(debt) financing
    - ❗️debt financing$\rightarrow$interest payments as fixed costs
    - proportion of debt financing in capital structure$\uparrow$, financial risk$\uparrow$

## 2. Operating/Financing/Total Leverage Calculation

- Degree of operating leverage(DOL)
  - Definition: $\% \Delta$Operating Income that result from $\% \Delta$Sales
  - Formula: $DOL=\frac{\frac{\Delta EBIT}{EBIT}}{\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}}$
    - $Q$: quantity of units sold
      - Formula with a given particular level of $Q$: $DOL=\frac{Q(P-V)}{Q(P-V)-F}$
        - $P$: price per unit
        - $V$: variable cost per unit
        - $F$: total fixed costs
        - denominator=$EBIT$ in this formula
    - lower Sales level, higher DOL.
    - if fixed cost=0, DOL=1-->no operating leverage
  - Interpretation: if sales increase $x\%$, EBIT will increase by $x\% * DOL$
- Degree of financial leverage(DFL)
  - Definition: the ratio of $\% \Delta$Net Income(or EPS) to $\% \Delta$EBIT
  - with a specific level of operating earnings,
    - Formula: $DFL=\frac{EBIT}{EBIT-I}$
      - $I$: interest expense
      - if no *interest expense*, DFL=1-->no financing leverage
  - Interpretation: if EBIT increase $x\%$, EPS will increase by $x\% * DFL$
- Degree of total leverage(DTL)
  - combine DOL and DFL, measuring the sensitivity of EPS to change in sales
  - Formula: $DTL=DOL*DFL=\frac{\% \Delta EPS}{\% \Delta Sales}=\frac{Q(P-V)}{Q(P-V)-F-I}=\frac{Sales-TVS}{Sales-TVC-F-I}$

## 3. Effect of Financial Leverage on Net Income and ROE

- usage of financial leverage increases <u>risk of default and potential reward</u> to common stockholder.
- ROE & rate of change for ROE变化幅度 is <u>higher using leverage</u> than without leverage.

## 4. Breakeven Quantity of Sales

- Breakeven Quantity
  - Definition: the level of quantity sales to generate revenue must enough to *cover all its fixed and variable cost*
    - @$Q^*$, when revenue=total costs, net income=0
  - ❗️Formula: $Q_{BE}=\frac{fixed \space operating \space costs+fixed financing \space costs}{price-VC \space per \space unit}$
  - Operating Breakeven Quantity of Sales: only care about fixed operating costs, without fixed financing costs
    - $Q_{OBE}=\frac{fixed \space operating \space costs}{price-VC \space per \space unit}$
- Contribution Margin:
  - Definition: the difference between <u>price and variable costs per unit</u>, for each unit sold.
- Some Relationships:
  - firms with higher financial or operating leverage have a higher breakeven quantity of sales
