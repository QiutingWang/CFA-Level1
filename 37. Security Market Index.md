# Reading 37 Security Market Index

## 1. Index Weighting Method

### 1) Describe a security market index

- Role: used to measure performance of markets, investment managers, asset class
- constituent securities of index: created as portfolios of individual securities
- index return: pct change in index value over a time
  - ie: index return=[weighted index@(t+1)/weighted index@t -1]*100%

### 2) Interpret Value, Price Return, Total Return of Index

- index return can be calculated using *price index* or *return index*
  - price index: use only **prices** of constituent securities when calculating return
  - return index: include both <u>prices and income</u> information
- price return: rate of return calculated based on a price index
- total return: rate of return calculated based on a return index
- if an asset in an index <u>produce interim cash flows</u> (dividend, interests payment), total return>price return
- after returns calculated *for each single period*, they <u>compounded together</u> to arrive at the return of a whole period
- Formula: $R_p=(1+R_{S1}(1+R_{S2})(1+R_{S3})...(1+R_{Sk})-1$
  - 这个计算在quant python里面有实现过

### 3) Describe Choice and Issue in Index Construction & Management

- Issues:
  - *target market* of the index aims to measure?
    - it can be selected from <u>geographic region or economic sector</u> respects
  - which *securities* from target market should be included?
    - constituent securities can be <u>all or representative sample</u> stocks in the market.
  - *how* should securities *weighted* in the index?
  - frequency of index rebalanced
  - timing of securities <u>selection and weighting re-examined</u>

### 4) Five Different Weight Methods

- **price-weighted index**
  - definition: simple *arithmetic prices average* of securities included in the index对价格算术平均
  - the divisor is changed when stock splits, when securities deleted or added(repurchase, issue stock dividend) that change in composition of index
    - index value does not change
  - advantage: simple calculation
  - disadvantage: given a certain percentage change in price of higher priced stock has greater impact on index value than that of lower priced stock.单个股票因自身价格大小，相同%程度的变动对指数影响不同
    - higher priced stock has **more weights** in price-weighted index calculation
  - Two major examples:
    - DJIA Dow Jones Industry Average(based on US 30 stocks)
    - Nikkei Dow Jones Stock Average(based on 225 stocks traded in Japan Tokyo stock exchange)
  - Special case: a portfolio has an <u>equal number of shares for each 成分股</u> will gain price return==price-weighted index return
- **equal-weighted index**
  - Calculation: arithmetic average return of index stocks
  - Trait:
    - match by portfolio return who have <u>equal dollar amount</u> invested in each index stock
    - weighted place on <u>small cap</u> firms' securities return > their proportion of overall market value of index stocks
  - adjust periodically(rebalance):
    - when price change→effect: *value of all security position* are made equal each period
    - result in <u>high transaction costs</u> that decreases returns
  - advantage: calculation simplicity
  - well-known examples: the Value Line Composite Average & Financial Times Ordinary Share Index
- **market capitalization weighted index(value weighted index)**
  - Definition: weights based on **market cap** of each index stock(current stock price* # of outstanding shares) as proportion of total market cap.
  - traits: 
    - reflect changes in <u>aggregate investor wealth</u> than pricing weight
    - rebalance and adjustment for *stock split or dividend payment* are <u>not needed</u>.
  - Market float: total value of shares that available to <u>investing public</u>, excluding shares held by <u>controlling shareholders</u>, corporations, government
    - free float: market float excludes shares do not available for *foreign buyers*, aiming to better match <u>stocks index weights</u> to the proportions of total value of *all shares available to investors* in index market.
  - well-known example: S&P500
- **float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted index**
  - structured similar to above one
  - Definitions: weights based on *proportion value* of each firm's shares that **are available to investors** to total market value of these available shares of index stock
  - traits: firm's share not available to investors↑ whose weights < unadjusted market-cap index
  - advantage: index security weights represent proportions of total market value反应市值
  - disadvantage:
    - when stock price↑, relative impact of stock return on index↑
      - when stock *overvalued*, giving <u>disproportionately high weights</u> in index
      - similar to momentum strategy: most successful stocks given greatest weights.
- **fundamental weighting**
  - Definition: use weights based on firm's fundamentals基本面(single or combined measures)
  - traits: unaffected by share prices of index stocks
  - advantages: avoid bias of market-cap indexes toward/away from index shares performance, called `value tilt`

### 5) Detail Calculation of Above Methods for Index Return

- **Price Weighting**
  - formula: price weighted index=sum of stock prices/# of stocks in index adjusted for splits
  - ❗️if there exist a stock split, price-weighted index remain unchanged, sum of stock prices decreases→we can get a new value of denominator
- **Market Cap Weighting**
  - formula: current index value=(current total market value of index stocks/base year total market value of index stock) *base year index value
    - base year index value = 100 normally.
    - market value=# of shares outstanding * market price
- **Equal Weighting:**
  - place an *equal weight* on the returns of all index stocks, regardless of *price or market values*.
  - Calculation: equal weighed index value=(1+average price change rate)*initial index value

## 2. Use and Type of Index

### 1) Rebalancing and Reconstitution of Index

- Rebalancing
  - Definition: adjusting weights of securities in portfolio to <u>target weights</u>, after price changes have affected weights usually quarterly.
  - it is issued primarily for <u>equal-weighted indexes</u>, owing to its *weights are not equal* as securities price change over time.
- Reconstitution
  - Definition: periodically add or delete constituent securities成分
    - delete security if no longer meet index criteria, or replaced by another one that does.
  - it reflects corporate events, such as <u>bankruptcy or index firm delisting</u>
  - relationship with specific security's price:
    - if a security is added/deleted to the index, its *price* tends to ↑/↓, cuz managers seeking to buy/sell it.
  - it also need weights <u>rebalancing or adjustment</u> to desired weighting scheme.

### 2) Security Market Index Usage

- Market sentiment reflection
  - provide a representative of market return, reflecting <u>investor's confidence</u>
  - broader market index represents, better measurement of sentiment 要看index的构成股多少，越多越好
- Manager performance benchmark
  - use to evaluate **active** manager for their chosen style
  - the index should be selected to be consistent to *manager's approach and style*
- Market risk and return measure: estimation of assets E(r) and std(r) are based on <u>corresponding index historical returns</u>
- Beta and risk-adjusted return measure: CAPM($\beta$, $R_f$)
- Index fund model portfolio: <u>passively investment</u> choosing to *invest an index fund*, replicating the performance of market index
  - index mutual funds, index exchange-traded fund

### 3) Types of Equity Index

- Broad market index:
  - market overall performance, containing >90% of market total value
  - eg: Wilshire 5000 index
- Multi-market index
  - in several countries to measure equity returns of a *geographic region*(Latin America Index), market based on their *economic development stage*(emerging markets index), or the *entire world*(MSCI World Index)
- Multi-market index with fundamental weighting: use market cap weighting
- Sector index: industry sector for analysts' <u>cyclical analysis</u>
  - some sectors perform better than others in different business cycle
  - some sector index for a *particular country or global*(strategy: sector rotation)
- Style index:
  - to measure returns to <u>market cap, value and growth strategies</u> and these combination.
    - use <u>PE ratios, dividend yield</u> to identify value and growth strategies
    - some stocks can move from one classification to another, high turnover

### 4) Security Market Index Comparison

### 5) Fixed-Income Indexes Types

- Construction:
  - created for geographical region, various sectors, country economic development levels
  - constructed based on <u>issuers, collateral, coupon, maturity, default risk, inflation protection</u>
- Issues:
  - large universe of securities:
    - bonds' universe *large broader* than stocks'
    - fixed-income indexes are not only issued by firms,but also governments
    - bonds can reach up to *maturity* which can be *replaced* by another, <u>higher turnover</u> than stock index
  - dealer markets and infrequent trading
    - primarily traded by *brokers* who need to estimate index security value *using recent price* of <u>securities with similar characteristic</u>, some data are difficult to obtain.
    - **illiquid, high turnover, transaction costs** make managers difficult to replicate fixed-income index

### 6) Alternative Investment Related Indexes

- Commodity index
  - future contract on commodities not spot prices
  - example: Thomoson Reuter, S&P GSCI
  - issues for investors:
    - weighting method: variety weighting scheme
    - future & actual
      - commodity future contract reflects Rf, change in future prices, roll yield
      - when contract up to maturity, it will be replaced by another contracts, high turnover
        - return on commodity futures != return on long-term position in commodity itself
- Real estate index
  - constructed using return based on <u>appraisal of properties物业评估, repeat property sales, performance on REITs</u>
    - REITs similar to *close-end mutual funds*, investing in properties and mortgages, issuing <u>ownership interests</u> to investors.
    - REIT shares traded like common shares, owning <u>high liquidity</u>.
- Hedge fund index:
  - most are **equal-weighting**
  - not regulated, don't need to report performance to index providers
  - using *leverage* and both long and short position
