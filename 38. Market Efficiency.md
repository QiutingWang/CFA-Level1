# Reading 38 Market Efficiency

## 1. Related Concepts and Importance to Investment Practitioners

- informationally efficient capital market
  - Definition: security current price <u>fully, quickly, rationally</u> reflect all available information about the security.
    - current securities price are *unbiased estimates* of values
    - expected return on securities = equilibrium return to compensate investors for future CF uncertainty risk.
    - implies that we cannot beat market
- Passive investment strategy:
  - should be used in *perfectly efficient market*
  - ie: buy *broad market index* and hold it
  - Reasons: active investment strategy will underperform owing to <u>transaction costs & management fees</u>
    - While, if inefficient market prices, active investment strategy generates risk-adjusted return>0.
- Method to Measure Market Efficiency:
  - determine the time it takes for <u>trading activity</u> to cause information to be reflect on *prices*
    - eg: in **foreign currency market**, the lag time can as short as *minute*
    - if there exists a *significant lag*, informed traders can use information to generate risk-adjusted return.
    - only <u>new unexpected information</u> can move price.

## 2. Market Value and Intrinsic Value

- market value: current asset price
- intrinsic/fundamental value: a rational investors with <u>full knowledge</u> about asset's characteristics would willing to pay.
  - can not be known certainty, but can be estimated. More <u>complex</u> the asset is, more *difficult* to intrinsic value estimation.
  - it can be *change consistently*, when new unexpected information becomes available.
- if market is high efficiency, current market price expected to reflect intrinsic value.

## 3. Factors Affect Market Efficiency

- Market can *not* be completely inefficient or perfectly efficient, there exists a series of **degree**.
- Factors:
  - number of market participants(investor, trader, analyst)↑, efficiency↑
  - information availability↑, efficiency↑
    - in large, developed markets(NYSE), information is plentiful大量的; While, in emerging markets, information availability is lower
    - Some assets(bonds, swap, currencies...) traded in *OTC(over-the-counter)*柜台买卖 markets, having less available information
      - OTC场外交易:
        - traded without listing on an exchange, but still regulated by SEC
        - tradings facilitate by dealer and brokers
    - information transformed should <u>be the same</u> to public regulated by *SEC Fair Disclosure*
      - traders with inside information cannot perform a trading based on it.内部信息知情者不允许利用它进行交易.
  - Impediments to trading妨碍
    - Arbitrage: buy an asset in one market and simultaneously sell it <u>at a higher price in another market</u>, until two markets get equal-->灵感：三角套利
    - the obstacle to trading↑, price inefficiency↑, arbitrage opportunity **is limited**.
    - short selling allowed, market efficiency↑.
  - transaction and information costs
    - if it > potential profit from trading mispricing securities, market prices inefficiency↑
    - after deduct costs, there are <u>no risk-adjusted returns</u> based on publicly available information→the market can be judged as efficient

## 4. Comparison Different Forms Market Efficiency

- Weak-form of EMH
  - past price and volume information cannot predict market direction of securities price(**no prediction power**) based on *past security market information*.
  - prices <u>changes independently</u> from one period to another
  - investor cannot achieve risk-adjusted return>0 on average, using **technical analysis**
- Semi-strong-form
  - prices rapidly adjust without bias to the new public information.
  - current prices <u>fully reflect all</u> *publicly available* information
  - securities price include all *past* security <u>market information and nonmarket information available to public</u>.
  - investors cannot achieve risk-adjusted return>0 on average, using **fundamental analysis**.
- Strong-form
  - current price fully reflect *all information* from <u>both public and private sources</u>
  - none should achieve abnormal returns >0 consistently.
  - <u>prohibition to insider trading</u>, prices are not expected to reflect all private information.--->market are not strong-form efficient.

## 5. Implication with Fundamental & Technical Analysis, Choice between Active & Passive PM

- Abnormal profit(also called *risk-adjusted returns*):
  - used to test market efficiency
  - if trading strategy expected return calculated from multi-factor model > equilibrium expected return→reject the corresponding EMH the strategy based.
- Technical analysis
  - show success in <u>emerging market</u>
  - test: if trading strategy based on TA produce abnormal return>0, we can reject weak-form EMH.
- Fundamental analysis
  - test: if trading strategy based on FA produce abnormal return>0, we can reject semi-strong-form EMH
  - it can be useful for investors who <u>act rapidly before</u> new information is reflected in prices.
- Another way to test *semi-strong-form* EMH--**Event Study**
  - definition: check the abnormal return <u>before and after new information release</u> which reflects firm intrinsic value
  - if trading strategy based on firm's event earn abnormal profit>0, we can reject semi-strong-form EMH
  - semi-strong-form market <u>inefficiency in some emerging market</u>.
- Active and Passive PM
  - if market <u>follow semi-strong-form</u> EMH, investors should *invest passively*.
  - some evidence shows that most mutual fund managers **cannot outperform** a passive index strategy over time.

## 6. Market Anomalies

- Test of EMH is also called anomaly studies, leading us to <u>reject EMH</u>.
- some variables related to abnormal returns. However, the relationship <u>unlikely to persist</u> over time. Frequency of recurrence is low.
  - Solutions: discover with *large sample data to verify* the relationship
- Anomalies in Time-Series Data
  - Calender anomalies
    - **January Effect** also called `turn-of-the-year-effect`
      - Phenomena: during the <u>first 5 days of January</u>, stock returns, especially for *small firms*, significant higher.
      - explanation: **tax-lossing sells**, **Window dressing**粉饰
        - investors <u>short lossing positions in December</u> to realize losses for *tax purpose*;
        - Then *repurchase stocks* in January of next year
    - **turn-of-the-month-effect**: stock returns higher in monthly ending days
    - **turn-of-the-week-effect**: average stock returns <0 on Monday
    - **weekend-effect**: <u>positive friday returns</u> are followed by negative Monday returns.
    - **holiday-effect**: *pre-holiday returns* are higher.
  - Overreaction and momentum anomalies
    - overreaction effects
      - Patterns: firms with <u>poor stock return</u> performance in *previous 3~5 years* have <u>better subsequent returns</u> than firms who have high stock return over prior period.
      - reason: investors overreaction to both unexpected good & bad news, nature of used *statistical tests*
    - momentum effects: high short-term returns are followed by continued high returns
      - reason: reflect *rational investor behavior*.
    - violate weak-form EMH
- Anomalies in Cross-Section Data
  - size effect:
    - initially found that small-cap stocks outperform large-cap stocks, but *not confirmed later*. It is a random result.
  - value effect 
    - **value stocks** have outperformed growth stocks
      - value stocks: with lower P/E, lower market-to-book ratio, higher dividend yields
      - growth stock: higher P/E, higher M/B, lower dividend yields
      - violate semi-strong-form EMH, due to the information used to firm classification is available
- Other Anomalies
  - closed-end investment funds
    - they are traded as **discount to net asset value(NAV)**. The discounts can be treated as anomalies.
    - reasons: future capital gains, management fees, share illiquidity, transaction costs
  - earnings announcements
    - **earning surprise** which is not expected by market
      - positive earning surprise-->periods of positive risk-adjusted *post-announcement stock returns*
      - negative earning surprise-->periods of **negative** risk-adjusted post-announcement stock return
    - *transaction costs will eliminate* the abnormal profits
  - IPO
    - typically <u>underpriced</u>, offer price < market price
    - from long-term perspective, IPO shares performance as a group is below average
    - investors overreact on the offer day,对上市公司未来发展过于乐观
    - ❗️it is not a kind of anomaly, but a result of <u>statistical methodologies</u> used to estimate abnormal return.
  - economic fundamentals
    - the relationship between <u>stock return & dividend yield</u> *not consistent* over all time period
- Notes:
  - portfolio strategy *only based on pervious identified anomalies* will likely to be <u>unprofitable</u>.
  - reported anomalies are not violate market efficiency, but statistical methodologies selection
  - <u>overreaction and underreaction</u> shows the market is efficient.

## 7. Behavior Finance and Potential Relevance to Understand Anomalies

- Behavior Finance:
  - actual decision-making process of investors
  - some investors are not rationally utility-maximizing decision makers with complete information
  - irrational investors can be a reason of various anomalies.
- Irrational Behavior:
  - loss aversion: investors dislike a loss than like same amount of gain.
  - investor overconfident: investors overconfidence about their ability to <u>analyze securities information</u> & identify differences between *market price and intrinsic values*.
  - herding聚集一起,从众: not active on private analysis, but refer to other investors' action, resulting from *information cascade*信息流
    - less informative traders watch and follow actions of informed traders
    - 跟随形成聚合效应<u>incorporate new information</u> to securities price, moving market prices *toward intrinsic value*, improving market efficiency.
