    - <u>smaller and risker firms</u> whose investors care about *firms' future upside potential* often issue participating preference shares.
  - Non-participating preference shares:
    - claim==preferred stock par value in liquidation

- Approaches

    - depository bank: 看守人
    - the value of DR is affected by <u>exchange rate changes, firm fundamentals, economic effects</u>, but investors do not have to convert to foreign currencies.
    - Sponsored DR: <https://prepnuggets.com/glossary/unsponsored-depository-receipt/>
      - foreign firms involved in the issuance of DR
      - investors of sponsored DR have *direct voting rights*, the *rights to receive dividends*, and greater disclosure requirements.
      - While, **unsponsored DR** are not obeying the above tips.

### 2) Risk and Return Comparison between Different Types of Equity Securities

- gains from dividend and reinvestment of dividend are the important part of equity holders' *long-term returns*
- risk of equity securities calculated by `std(returns)`
  - risky(average return) of preferred stock< common stock
  - cumulative preferred shares risk< non-cumulative preferred shares
  - *putable* shares risk(return) < callable shares risk
    - that is, when prices drop, putable shareholders can <u>put shares back to firm at a fixed price</u>, but with lower dividend.
    - if market price raise, companies will call the callable shares, limiting upside potential. But with higher dividend yields.

### 3) Role of Equity Securities in Company Assets Financing

- Equity capital is used to:
  - purchase long-term assets, equipment, R&D
  - expansion to new business or geographical area
  - buy other companies
  - offer to employees as incentive compensation
  - equity trading provides **liquidity**, to <u>meet regulatory requirements, capital adequacy ratios, and liquidity ratios</u>.

### 4) Market Value & Book Value of Equity Securities

- Primary goal of management: increase book value of equity, thereby increase market value of equity
- book value:
  - asset value-liability on balance sheet
  - it increases when <u>positive net income and retained earnings</u> flow into equity account
- market value
  - total value of firm's *outstanding equity shares* based on *market prices* and reflect investors' expectation about firm's *future performance*
  - investors use their <u>risk and future cash flow timing</u> to determine market value of equity
- book and market value of equity *are seldom equal*.

### 5) Cost of Equity & ROE & Investor Required Rates of Return

- ROE
  - $ROE_t=\frac{NI_t}{(BV_t+BV_{t-1})/2}$
    - $NI_t$: net income available to **common**, minus preferred dividend
    - more accurate when <u>industry convention or book value is volatile</u>.
  - another calculation method: only use beginning period of book value of equity $ROE_t=\frac{NI_t}{BV_{t-1}}$
    - more suitable when book value is *stable*, or we want to *check ROE for a number of years*
  - Analysis:
    - higher ROE as a positive sign of firm, but the detailed reason we need to examine:
      - if ROE increases results from <u>a rapid decrease of book value</u>, it is not a positive sign of firm.
      - if firm <u>issues debt to repurchase equity</u> to decrease BV of equity, ROE↑, but that makes companies share more riskier.
- Market-to-Book Ratio
  - more optimistic about firm future growth, higher M2B
  - used to measure **relative value**
  - firm with *low* M2B ratio is considered as *value stocks*, who has <u>high M2B ratio</u> can be treated as *growth stocks*
- Cost of Equity & Investor Required Rate of Return
  - expected equilibrium total return on its shares in market
  - estimated by CAPM or Dividend Discount Model(DDM)
  - share price↑, expected returns↓
    - reasons: shares' <u>intrinsic</u> value is *discounted present value* of future CF, if required return used to discounted↑, intrinsic value↓
  - if investor's <u>minimum required rate of return</u> given a specific risk level > expected market return(cost of return)→refuse to invest this firm
    - **cost of capital** can be treated as minimum required rate of return.
