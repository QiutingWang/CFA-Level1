## 1. Industry Analysis

### 1) Usage of Industry Analysis & Relationship with Company Analysis

- Industry analysis <u>provides framework</u> and <u>business conditions</u> for understanding the firm.
- give an insight of firms' potential growth, competition, and risks
- for credit analysis, it provides information about whether company can <u>meet the obligation during next recession</u>.
- for active management, it helps to identify which industries are *undervalued or overvalued* to <u>weight</u> them properly.(**industry rotation**行业轮动Quant strategy)
- for performance attribute analysis, source of portfolio return are determined related to benchmark.

### 2) Company Grouping Method

- by products & service they offer
  - sector: a group of similar industries
  - use *principle business activity*, the main source of sales or earnings to classify firm
    - eg: Global Industry Classification Standard(GICS), Russell Global Sectors(RGS), Industry Classification Benchmark
- by sensitivity to business cycle
  - classified as *cyclical & non-cyclical*
- by statistical method
  - clustering model groups firm with <u>historically highly correlated returns</u>.
  - limitations:
    - historical != future high correlation
    - the grouped firms can differ over time or across countries
    - non-intuitive
    - susceptible to statistical error(grouped *by chance*)

### 3) Factors Affect Sensitivity Firm's Response to Business Cycle & Descriptors' Usage and Limits

- Cyclical firm
  - firms' earnings highly dependent on stage of business cycle with <u>high earnings' volatility and high operating leverage</u>.
  - ❗️products are <u>expenses, non-necessities</u>
  - experience wider-than-average fluctuations in demand.
  - eg of cyclical industries: materials, energy, financial services, technology, industry and producer durables, consumer discretionary非必需消费品.
- Non-Cyclical firm
  - definition: products demand relative stable
  - eg of non-cyclical industries: health care, utilities, telecommunications, consumer staples必需消费品.
  - Sub-classification:
    - Defensive industries: at least affected by business cycle stage
    - Growth industries: strong demand
- Descriptor:
  - non-cyclical firm can also be affected by <u>severe recession</u>, and they are may not always *safe investments*.
    - reasons: other risky factors, such as intense price competition
- 🌟limitation of Cyclic/Non-cyclic descriptive approach:
  - Business-cycle sensitivity lies in a continuous spectrum.
  - A cyclical company may have a growth component in it.
  - A <u>global company</u>跨国公司 can experience *economic expansion* in <u>one part of the world</u> while experiencing *recession* in another part.

### 4) Current Industry Classification System

- Effects:
  - provides a method of <u>examining trends and firm valuation</u>
  - compare firm in different countries on similar basis
- Industry Classification System:(GICS, Russell Global Sectors, Industry Classification Benchmark by Dow Jones)
  - **commercial classification**: by products and service they provide
    - Basic materials and processing, consumer discretionary非必需消费品(eg: automobile manufacture), consumer staples, energy, financial service, healthcare, industrial and producer durables工业和生产耐用品(defense国防, Aerospace航天...), real state(REITs), technology, telecommunications(wired and wireless service provider), utilities
  - **Government classification**: government aims to organize economic data they publish, making comparison *between country across time*.
    - International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activity(ISIC): US in 1948
    - Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the *European* Community
    - Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification 
    - North American Industry Classification System(NAICS): US, Canadian, Mexico, updates every 5 years
  - Notes:
    - most governments don't identify individual firms in group, While commercial classification does
    - <u>updates less frequently</u> than commercial ones.
    - governments *do not divide* for-profit/not-for-profit, private/public, small/large firms; While, commercial classification only include *for-profit, public* firms.
    - analyst cannot directly compare 2 firms in <u>the same narrowest</u> industry classification from fundamental analysis and valuation.

### 5) Industry Classification Used in Equity Valuation

- **Peer group**:
  - Definition:
    - a set of similar companies analysts used to valuation comparison.
    - they are similar in <u>business activities, demand drivers, cost structure drivers, capital availability</u>
  - Formation steps: subjective process, not a standard process
    - use <u>commercial classification</u> providers to determine whether target companies *in the same industry*
    - review firms *annual reports* to identify <u>key competitors</u>
    - examine *competitors' annual report* to check whether there <u>exists any other named competitors</u>
    - use <u>industry trade publications</u> to identify competitors
    - *confirm* comparable firms actually have <u>similar sales and earnings sources, demand sources, in similar geographic market</u>
    - *adjust FS* of *non-financial companies* for <u>financial subsidiary data</u>

### 6) Industry Analysis Elements Coverage

- relationship between <u>macroeconomic and industry trend</u>
- estimate *industry variables* using different approaches and scenarios
- get <u>relative valuation</u> of different industries
- classify industries by life-cycle stage(embryonic初期的, growth, shakeout重组期, mature, declining)
- examine the *forces* that determine *competition* within industry.
- factors affect industries: demographic, macroeconomic, governmental, social, technology influences
- compare with other *other analyst forecasts* of industry variables, checking whether the forecast is <u>valid or potential misvalued</u>
- track industries valuation *across time* to determine <u>volatility of performance</u> over long run and <u>different phases in business cycle</u>.
  - it is good for <u>long-term investment and short-term industry rotation</u> based on current industry environment.
- based on **strategic groups**, that is, groups of firms *distinguish from remaining firms* in industry, owing to barrier to entry行业壁垒 or products delivery & complexity优质产品
- industry position in **experience curve**, which shows cost per unit relative to output
  - for industries with *high fixed costs*, the curve ↓ because of <u>productivity increases and scale of economies</u>.

### 7) Industry Strategy Analysis Principles

- Economic profits=return on invested capital - costs
  - factor: pricing power
  - industry analysis should be <u>forward-looking</u>
- Strategy Analysis: the *competitive environment* of industry influence firm's strategy
- Five Force:
  - rivalry竞赛、对抗 among existing competitors
    - rivalry increases when numbers of firms with <u>relative equal size</u> compete within an industry.
    - *slow growth* results in competition, resulting from high maturity
    - high fixed costs result in *price decreases*, owing to firm would like to *operate at full capacity*, to reduce per-unit costs and increase profit.
    - industries with <u>high barrier to exit or undifferentiated products</u> have high level competition.
    - greater **concentration**(few companies control large market shares) reduces competition
    - <u>prolonged unused capacity</u> leads to intense price competition.
    - *stable market share* reduce competition.
  - entry threats
    - industries with <u>significant barriers</u> to entry are easier to keep premium price level, less competitive comes from new competitors.
    - factors: eg, economies of scale
  - substitute threats: limit the price firms can charge by increasing demand elasticity
  - power of buyers: buyers' ability to bargain for lower prices or higher quality
    - <u>more price sensitivity in customer</u> buying decisions, competition↑.
  - power of suppliers: suppliers' ability to raise price or limit supply

## 2. Pricing Power & Company Analysis

### 1) Factors of Pricing Power and Price Competition

- Entry Barrier
  - method to measure ease of entry:
    - from how easily newcomers obtain <u>capital, intellectual property, customer base</u>
    - examine *composition of industry* over time看垄断市场份额的公司持续的时间
  - high entry barrier doesn't mean firm pricing power is high
    - eg, industries with *intense pricing competition* with **undifferentiated products and commodity-like**
    - while, companies with product differentiation in <u>features, reliability, service after sale</u> respect have greater pricing power.
  - low entry barrier doesn't ensure success for new entrants
  - barriers may change over time
- Industry Concentration
  - high industry concentration doesn't ensure pricing power
    - the *relative market shares* with firm's competitors is matter.如果几家垄断公司各自所占市场规模差不多，single firm's <u>pricing power and return on capital is low</u>
    - if industry is <u>capital intensive</u>, leading to *intense* price competition.
  - eg:
    - high industry concentration with high pricing power: Tobacco, alcohol, and confections甜食,糕点
      - industry members seldom competition in price
    - high industry concentration with low pricing power: Automobiles, aircraft, and oil refining油提纯
- Industry Capacity
  - Relationship between capacity and pricing power:
    - Undercapacity: demand>supply @current prices→high pricing power and return on capital
    - overcapacity: 与上面情况相反
  - capacity is fixed in short run, variable in long run.
  - when producer <u>overshoot optimal industry capacity</u>, especially in *cyclical market*, companies cannot achieve meeting a *demand at minimum average costs*.
  - capacity is not necessarily physical: eg, increase in demand for insurance
    - physical capacity has a *low liquidation value*清算价值,*costly to reallocate* to a different product.
- Market Share Stability
  - Interpretation: if industry market shares composition is *highly variable* that indicates *highly competitive*, firms have little pricing power.
  - factor affects stability:
    - entry barrier
    - introduce of new products and innovations
    - switching costs of customers from one firm to another

### 2) Industry Life-Cycle Model & Limitations

- Life-cycle model can be components of strategic analysis, impacting industry competition, growth, profits
- graph: X-axis: time; Y-axis: demand
- 5 Stages:
  - **embryonic**
    - character:
      - slow growth: customer unfamiliar with new products
      - high prices: volume of economics of scale cannot reach
      - large investment required, high failure risk
  - **growth**
    - rapid growth: new customers discover the products
    - limited competitive pressures: grow <u>without price competition</u>, new entry threat comes to peak
    - falling prices & increasing profitability: economics scales are reached, distribution channels increase
    - firm not pay out cash flow, saving it for internal growth
  - **shakeout**
    - growth slowed: demand goes to saturation level with few new customers
    - intense competition
    - industry overcapacity increases: supply>demand, profitability decline
    - cost cutting increased: firm *restructure* to survive and build *customer loyalty*
    - failures increase due to weaker firms are <u>liquidate or acquired</u>.清算收购
  - **mature**
    - little industry growth and consolidation联合(供过于求), few opportunity to introduce new products. Growth due to population changes
    - higher barrier to entry市场饱和: surviving firms have <u>brand loyalty and low cost structures</u>
    - stable pricing: firms避免价格战，除了recession时期
    - superior firms gain *market share*: firms with better products <u>grow faster than industrial average</u>.
    - focus on cost efficiency
    - firm pays out cash to investors in dividend or stock repurchases, internal growth is limited
  - **declining**
    - negative growth: because of substitute products, global competition
    - price decline: intense competition, price war due to overcapacity
    - consolidation: failed firms exit or merged
- industries do not always follow the structure above, it will *be skipped* or *not equal time length* as anticipated.
  - due to technology change, government policy, societal change, or demographic, <u>products will be obsolete</u> easily.
  - while, life-cycle is a useful tool in **stable** periods.
  - some firms will have *growth and profits dissimilar* to others.

### 3) External Factors Affect Industry Growth, Profitability, Risk(strategic analysis components)

- Macroeconomic factors
  - can be cyclical or structural trend
  - economic output can be measured as GDP
  - *interests rate* affects firm financing costs and financial institution profitability
  - <u>credit availability</u> affects consumer and business *expenditures and funding*
  - *inflation* affects costs, prices, interest rates, business confidence
  - *education level of work force*, more educative workers <u>increase productivity and real wages</u>, goods demand↑
- Technology
  - introducing new and improved products change industry dramatically
  - 连带效应，有可能带动影响其他相关的industry
- Demographic: age distribution, population size, population composition
- Governments: by <u>tax and regulation</u> has important and widespread effect on business
  - discouraged: tobacco is heavily taxed in US
  - controlled: entry into healthcare industry is required <u>license doctors</u> by governments
  - empower self-regulatory organizations授权: eg stock exchanges
  - give support: eg, <u>defense industry</u> depends heavily on government purchases
- Social Influence:人们生活方式，衣食住行
- Environmental Influence: climate change, ESG
  - 3 primary considerations:
    - consumer *perceptions*感知 about industry and firms have impact on growth & profitability
    - increased *government regulations* produce changes in <u>industry operation way and demand drivers</u>
    - change in <u>water and energy shortages, weather pattern</u> will affect *agriculture and utilities*.
  - eg: 植物肉代替肉类, electric-powered vehicles, battery and charging stations, alternative energy

### 5) Company Analysis Elements

- content:
  - financial conditions, products, service, competitive strategy
    - competitive strategy: how a firm responses to opportunities and external environment threats, can be defensive or offensive
      - two important competitive strategies firms can employ within an industry:
        - **cost leadership strategy**
          - seek for <u>lowest production costs</u> in industry and ask for *lowest prices*
          - generate <u>enough volume</u> to make a superior return
          - can be defensively or offensively
          - predatory掠夺的 pricing: firm wants to drive out competitors, increasing prices, but with law restriction
          - investment and financing at <u>low cost of capital</u> and in productivity-improving equipment.
          - can be *managerial incentives* by <u>improving operating efficiency</u>
        - **product or service differentiation strategy**
          - distinctive products
          - differentiation cost<< sustainable price premium
          - its firms may have <u>outstanding marketing research or creative personnel</u>
- Elements🌟:
  - firm overview(strength, weakness, operation, governance), industry characteristics, product demand/costs, pricing environments, financial ratios(ROE& DuPond Analysis) and comparison with other firms, FS and firm valuation
  - use *spreadsheet* to analyze and forecast fundamentals with explanation
