# Reading 41 Equity Valuation Concepts and Tools

## 1. Dividends, Splits, and Repurchases

### 1) Check Whether Security is Fairly Valued

- comparing <u>actual market value and estimated intrinsic value</u>, we can draw conclusions whether stock price is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued.
- Issues to determine whether investing based on the difference:
  - the <u>larger percentage difference</u> between market value and estimated value, _more likely_ investors make investment decision <u>based on intrinsic value estimation</u>.
  - more confident investors on the _appropriateness valuation model used_,...
  - more confident investors on the _estimated inputs_ used in valuation model,...
  - consider the <u>sensitivity of a model value to its input</u>...
  - marker prices can be treated as _fairly reliable indicators_ of intrinsic value. Because investors will carious about <u>why stock is mispriced</u> in market.
  - investors believe that market price will move toward estimated intrinsic value within investment horizon.
  - _few investors follow_ the stock when there is a mispricing, the analyst is confident in model inputs.

### 2) Equity Valuation Models Categories

- DDM(present value method): PV of cash available to shareholders, after firm meets capital expenditures and working capital expenses(free cash flow to equity)
- multiplier models
  - ratios of stock prices used to determine whether a stock is fairly valued. Eg: P/E ratio
  - ratios of enterprise value
    - **enterprise value**=**market value** of all firm's outstanding securities(common&preferred stock&debt) - cash - short term investment
      - measures total company value
      - can be treated as what it would cost to acquire the firm
    - estimated common stock value=estimated enterprise value - liabilities value - preferred stock
- asset-based model:
  - (_market value or fair value_)total asset value-liabilities-preferred stock=common stock intrinsic value
  - when estimated <u>marker value</u> of equity, analyst adjusts book value of asset & liabilities to fair value

### 3) Related Concepts

- cash dividend:
  - regularly scheduled dividends
    - company pays a _portion of profits_ on schedule consistently
    - a recorded _stable or increasing_ dividends is a <u>healthy company financial stability</u> sign.
  - one-time special dividends
    - when favorable situation allow firm to make a one-time cash payment to shareholders
    - many <u>cyclical firms</u> will use this method
    - also called `extra dividend` or `irregular dividend`
- stock dividend
  - dividend paid off in form of _new shares_ of stock instead of cash-->more outstanding shares, but value each share↓, total value of equity unchanged
  - expressed as percentage
- stock split
  - divide each existing shares into multiple shares-->price of each share drop, total owner wealth keep the same
  - ❗️expressed as ratio: N-for-1, mains each old share is split into N new shares
  - more commonly used in reality than stock dividend
- reserve stock splits
  - opposite of stock splits-->fewer shares outstanding with a higher stock price, total equity owners value unchanged
- share repurchase
  - company buys outstanding shares of its own common stock, to support their stock, or management believes their stock is <u>undervalued</u>.
  - used to <u>offset an increasing</u> of outstanding shares due to the _exercises of employee stock options_.
  - it can be <u>alternative to cash dividends</u> for distributing cash to shareholders
    - in some countries, when tax capital gains at lower rate than dividend, shareholders _prefer repurchase_.

### 4) Dividend Payment Chronology

- declaration date: broad approves dividend payment with per-share dividend amount
- ex-dividend date:
  - the first day on which a share purchaser will _not receive_ next dividend 相当于一阶段的截止日期
  - 1 or 2 business days _before_ the holder-of-record date
  - if you buy share <u>on or after</u> ex-dividend date, you will _not receive_ the dividend, which will go to the <u>seller</u>.
  - the share price will ↓ from <u>previous day's closing price</u> by ≈amount of dividend, without other affecting factors
- holder-of-record date(record date): all owners of shares being entitled 有资格 to receive dividend payment.提名类的
- payment date: the date dividends are paid to record holders.

## 2. Dividend Discount Models(DDM)

### 1) Present Value Models, Dividend Discount, and FCF-to-Equity Model

- General form:$V_0=\sum_{t=1}^{\infin}\frac{D_t}{(1+k_e)^t}$, without explicit terminal value of stock
  - $V_0$: current stock value
  - $D_t$: dividend at time $t$
  - $k_e$: required rate of return on common equity
- One-year holding period DDM:
  - intuition: PV of dividend payment+PV of expected stock price at the end of year
  - $value=\frac{D}{(1+k_e)}+\frac{year-end \space price}{(1+k_e)}$
- The finite Multi-year DDM can be expressed as: $V_0=\sum_{t=1}^{n}\frac{D_t}{(1+k_e)^t}+\frac{P_n}{(1+k_e)^n}$
  - it can be used when companies pay current dividend, not pay currently but will pay in the future, or not pay dividends currently or in the future.
  - lessly consider book value in this method
- Free Cash Flow to Equity(FCFE):
  - often used in discounted CF model instead of dividend
  - cash remaining after paying debt obligations and capital expenditures, available to equity holders
  - Calculation:
    - $FCFE=NetIncome+Depreciation-\Delta ↑WorkingCapital-FCInv-DebtPrinciplePayment+NewDebtIssues$, based on income statement
    - $FCFE=CFO-FCInv+NetBorrowing$, based on CF statement
      - Net borrowing=amount borrowed-amount repaid. Increase in debt.
      - it is projected for future periods
    - DDM with FCFE:$V_0=\sum_{t=1}^{\infin} \frac{FCFE_t}{(1+k_e)^t}$
- Estimate Required Return of Equity$k_e$:
  - Calculation with CAPM: $k_i=R_f+\beta_i[E(R_{mkt})-\beta_f]$
  - estimation with debt:
    - if firms have <u>publicly traded debt</u>, estimated _required return of equity_=risk premium+firm current bond yield
    - if firm doesn't have publicly traded debt, estimated required return of equity=risk premium(larger one)+government bond yield

### 2) Non-callable, Non-convertible Preferred Stock Intrinsic Value Calculation

- preferred stocks usually have fixed amount dividend, infinite maturity.
- Calculation: preferred stock value=$\frac{D_p}{k_p}$

### 3) Gordan(Constant) Growth DDM, Two-Stage DDM

- Constant growth DDM infinite: $V_0=\frac{D_0(1+g_c)}{k_e-g_c}=\frac{D_1}{k_e-g_c}$
  - $g_c$: growth rate of dividend, unchanged
    - analyst needs to determine _how much dividend increases_ is due to _dividend growth_.
      - value with $k_e>g_c>0$ Minus value when $g_c=0$
    - $g_c$ estimation with 3 methods:
      - firm dividend's _historical_ growth
      - firm's <u>industry median</u> dividend growth rate
      - estimate **sustainable growth rate**
        - calculation: $sustainable \space growth=retention \space rate*ROE$
          - retention rate=1-dividend payout ratio=1- (dividend payout/net income)
            - the proportion of net income not paid out as dividends, going to REs.
          - Assumptions: ROE & dividend payout ratio are constant, no new equity sold
        - intuition: at which <u>equity, earnings, dividends</u> can continue to grow indefinitely.
  - $k_e>g_c$
    - ↑, stock value↓
    - small changes in $k_e$ and $g_c$ will result in large changes in stock values.
      - As results, analysts should calculate multiple different estimations using a range of $k_e$ and $g_c$
  - Reasons for Company not pay dividend currently:
    - in financial distress and cannot afford to pay out cash
    - return firm can earn by _reinvesting cash_ > stockholders expect to <u>earn by investing dividends</u>.
    - As a result, when using DDM valuation, analyst must ensure the <u>timing and amount</u> of _first_ dividend payment, when estimating firms with no current dividend.计算的最后一步要将 FV-->PV。
- Multi-stage DDM
  - companies with extremely <u>high growth rate</u> will _attract competition_, then $g$ eventually fall.
  - Hence, a _sustainable growth rate_ is reasonable to calculate PV of expected future dividend.
  - Calculation: $value=\frac{D_1}{1+k_e}+\frac{D_2}{(1+k_e)^2}+...+\frac{D_n}{(1+k_e)^n}+\frac{P_n}{(1+k_e)^n}$
  - Steps:(high-growth stage+with constant growth rate)
    - determine discount rate $k_e$
    - estimate the size and duration of the high initial dividend growth $g^*$
    - estimate dividends during high-growth period
    - estimate constant growth rate $g_c$
    - estimate the <u>first dividend</u> that will growth at $g_c$
    - use $g_c$ to calculate the stock price
    - add up PV of all dividends and PV of terminal stock price

### 4) Identify Characteristic of Companies Who Use 3) Models

- Constant Growth Model is appropriate for companies: stable, mature, non-cyclical, dividend-paying.
- 3 stage model categorized as <u>growth, transition, and maturity</u>
  - it is suitable for a _young firm_
- When companies do _not pay dividend currently_, the dividend estimation will be 投机.
  - valuation <u>based on FCFE</u> is a good choice, as long as growth rate can be estimated
  - OR valuation based on price multiplier

## 3. Relative Valuation Measures

### 1) Price Multiplier Valuation Based on Fundamental and Comparable

- Price multiplier:
  - Definition: analyst compares price multipliers to _benchmark value_
    - benchmark value: index, industry group of firm, peer group of firm within the same industry, stocks historical average(a time series comparison)
  - Evaluation:
    - Advantage: simple, information is availability
    - disadvantage: reflect past using historical data
- Multiplier based on comparable(fundamental): compare a multiplier based on <u>market price(some valuation model)</u>

### 2) Multipliers Interpretation

#### Different Ratios

- P/E ratios: price divided by earnings per share, widely used
  - P/E based on <u>fundamental</u> called <u>justified P/E</u> or _leading P/E_
    - $\frac{P_0}{E_1}=\frac{D_1/E_1}{k-g}$ based on _Constant Growth valuation model_.
      - based on _expected next period earnings_, instead of <u>actual</u> earnings which will produce `lagging or trailing P/E`
      - $D_1/E_1$: expected dividend payout ratio
      - <u>higher debt to equity</u>, more risky and bigger required rate of return, _less_ P/E ratio.
    - sensitive to inputs, as results, using <u>several different sets of inputs</u> within a range is reasonable.
    - dividend displacement of earnings: dividend payout rate↑, sustainable growth rate↓, P/E ratios↑, firm value↑.
      - but firms <u>cannot continually</u> increase P/E or market value by increasing dividend payout ratio.
- Price-Sales ratios(P/S): stock price divided by sales per share
- Price-book value(P/B) ratio: stock price divided by book value of equity per share
- Price-cash flow(P/CF) ratio: stock price divided by CFO or FCF per share
- others are used in specific industries

#### Based on Comparable

- law of one price: similar or comparable assets should have approximately same multiple or at the same price.
- Analysts should ensure any comparables are actually comparable
- for cyclical firms, P/S ratio is preferred than P/E ratios, owing to <u>sales are less volatile</u>.

### 3) Enterprise Value Multiples and Usage in Equity Valuation

- it is useful when comparing the firms with <u>significantly differences in capital structure</u>
- EV/EBITDA or EV/operating income are frequently used multipliers
  - disadvantages:
    - _non-cash_ revenues and expenses will include
    - market value of firms' debt often not available
      - solution: use the <u>similar bonds' market value or use its book value</u>
- if competitor and industry average is <u>above the calculated result</u>, the target company is _relatively undervalued_.

### 4) Asset-Base Valuation Model

- if market value are difficult to obtain, analysts start from balance sheets
- approach to asset valuation:
  - at depreciated values
  - inflation-adjusted depreciated values
  - estimated replacement values
- considered as minimum or floor value, when significant intangibles
- supplementing with a more _forward-looking_ valuation, eg DDM.

### 5) Evaluation of Each Valuation Methods

- **DDM**:
  - Advantage
    - based on fundamental concepts of <u>discounted PV</u> and well grounded in finance theory
    - widely accepted
  - Disadvantage
    - inputs may be estimated($k_e$, $g_c$)
    - value estimations are sensitive to input values
- **Comparable valuation using price multiples**:
  - Advantages
    - some multiples are used to predict stock returns
    - widely used by analysts and already available
    - can be used in time series and cross-sectional comparisons
    - $EV/EBITDA$ is useful when firms' earning<0, P/E ratio can not be used; firm's value independent of capital structure
  - Disadvantages
    - lagging price multiples reflect the past
    - if firm with <u>different size, product, in different industries, or growth rate</u>, multiples are not comparable across firms.
    - <u>cyclical firms</u> may be greatly affected by economic conditions
    - stock may looks like overvalued by comparable method,but undervalued by fundamental method, vice versa.不一致
    - <u>different accounting method</u> leads to incomparable across firms, especially internationally.
    - price multiplier's denominator<0--> a meaningless ratio. Eg: P/E
- **Price multiples based on fundamentals**:
  - advantages
    - correspond to _widely accepted_ value metrics
    - based on _theoretically_ sound valuation models
  - disadvantages
    - sensitive to inputs
- **Asset-based models**:
  - advantages
    - provide floor values
    - useful for public firm with _reported fair values_ valuation
    - useful when firms primarily <u>tangible short-term assets, when firm is liquidating, asset with ready market values</u>.
  - disadvantages
    - market values are different to obtain
    - market values are usually different from _book values_
    - during _hyperinflation_, assets are difficult to value
    - inaccurate when firms with <u>high proportion of intangible assets</u>, or _future cash flows_ not reflected in asset values.
