  - it is not based on actual transactions
  - manipulated by bankers expected interbank lending rates, replace LIBOR with market-determined rates.
    - regulations not require to report the estimated rates used to determine LIBOR.
    - in the US, the new rate is **Secured Overnight Financing Rate(SOFR)**
      - based on <u>actual rates of repurchase transactions</u>
