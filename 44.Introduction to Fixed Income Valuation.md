# Reading 44 Introduction to Fixed Income Valuation

## 1. Bonds Valuation and Yield to Maturity

### 1) Bond Price Calculation with Market Discount Rate

- Calculating value of annual coupon bond: sum PV of all bonds promised cash flows
- Yield-to-Maturity(YTM):market discount rate
- when yields↓, PV of bond's payments, market value↑
  - if yield< discount rate, bond sell at premium
  - if yield> discount rate, bond buy at discount
  - bond's price-yield relationship is convex
- When calculating bond value with a semi-annual coupon payments: N: semi-annually counted; Yield:在年化率的基础上减半
- When calculating value of zero-coupon bond, that is, discounted <u>present value of maturity payment</u>

### 2) Some Relationships

- Relationships between Price and Yield:
  - YTM↓, bond prices↑负相关
  - Convexity: % ↓ in value when YTM ↑ by a given amount < ↑ in value when YTM↓ by same amount受YTM下降，bond price上升的更明显,slope更大
  - price of bond with <u>a lower coupon rate</u> is more *sensitive to yield changes* than that of bond with a higher coupon rate.
  - price of bond with a *longer maturity* is more *sensitive to yield changes* than that of bond with a shorter maturity
  - Graphical Analysis:
    - X-axis: market yield; Y-axis: bond value
    - trend: decreasing, slopes is getting smaller as YTM increases
    - convexity of the curve
- Relationships between Price and Maturity
  - **constant-yield price trajectory**: convergence to par value at maturity

## 2. Spot Rates and Accrued Interest

### 1) Spot Rates

- Definition:
  - market discount rate for a single payment to be received in the future
  - refer to *zero-coupon rates, zero rates*
- Calculation Bond Price with Spots Rate:
  - $PV=\frac{CPN_1}{1+S_1}+\frac{CPN_2}{(1+S_2)^2}+...\frac{CPN_N+FV_N}{(1+S_N)^N}$
  - this price is called **non-arbitrage price** of a bond
    - if bond is priced differently, there will be an opportunity to make profit from arbitrage
  - Then we can use the calculated price to get YTM by calculator.

### 2) Flat Price, Accrued Interest, Full Price of Bond

- Facts: settlement date sometimes *falls between coupon payment dates*.
- flat price=full price-accrued interest
  - also called *clean price* or *quoted price*
  - represents bond value <u>excluding the interest that has accrued</u> since the *last* coupon payment.
- accrued interest since last coupon payment=PMT*(t/T)
  - t: number of days since last coupon payment
  - T: number of days between two coupon dates
- full price(true price)
  - also called *dirty price*, *invoice price*
  - Calculation: $PV^*=PV'×(1+YTM/N)^{t/T}$
    - N: # of coupon period per year
    - PV': last coupon period present value of bond
- `Actual/Actual` often used with <u>government bonds</u>
  - assumes actual days in every month and actual days in every year.每个月有多少天就是多少天
- `30/360 days` fraction is usually used, for <u>corporate bonds</u>
  - assumes 30 days in every month and 360 days in every year
- For calculating spreads between government bond and corporate bond, <u>corporate bonds will be restated</u> as *actual/actual basis*统一,但发过来转化不可以

### 3) Matrix Pricing for Illiquid Bonds

- Definition: to estimate *required YTM or price* of bonds which are <u>currently not traded or infrequently traded</u>.
- Method:
  - use YTM of traded bonds with similar credit quality, maturity, and coupon with not traded or infrequently traded bonds, to estimate required YTM同类估算法
  - 🌟linear interpolation线性插值
    - Given conditions:
      - the target bonds(Z) with T year remaining maturity, a% annual coupon rate
      - X bond with T1(< T) years maturity, b% YTM
      - Y bond with T2(>T) years maturity, c% YTM
    - YTM of Z=b%+(c%-b%)*[(T-T1)/(T2-T1)]
- Variation: used for <u>pricing new bond issues</u> focus on spreads差价 between *bond* yields and yield of *benchmark bond* with similar maturity and default risk free
  - benchmark chosen: Treasury bonds, for US dollar-denominated corporate bonds
  - 🌟Given condition:
    - target newly issued bond A, with T year maturity
    - T1(< T) maturity, Treasury bond YTM a%
    - T1(< T) maturity, same credit rating corporate bond YTM b%
    - T2(> T) maturity, Treasury bond YTM c%
    - T2(> T) maturity, same credit rating corporate bond YTM d%
    - T maturity, Treasury bond YTM e%
  - Calculation:
    - spreads between corporate bond and benchmark:
      - spread on T1=b%-a%=f%
      - spread on T2=d%-c%=g%
    - fractional spread of target bond:
      - avg=(f%+g%)*[(T-T1)/(T2-T1)]
    - add average spread to treasury bond YTM with same maturity:
      - YTM for Target newly issued bond=avg+e%

## 3. Yield Measures

### 1) Yield Measures for Fixed-Rate Bonds

- Given coupon rate, periodicity↑, compounding periods↑, annual yields↑
  - periodicity: number of bond coupon payment per year
- annual effective yield=$(1+\frac{YTM}{n})^n-1$
  - $n$: periodicity
  - $YTM$: stated annual rate
- street convention yields: bond yields calculated using *stated* coupon payment dates
  - some coupon dates will fall on weekends or holidays
- true yields: bond yields calculated using the <u>actual coupon payment dates</u>
  - when meet the special dates mentioned above, payments will be made the *next business day*.
  - <u>sightly lower</u> than street convention yields
- Current yields=annual cash coupon payment/bond price
  - also called *income yield* or *running yield*
  - offer limited information, because it doesn't consider <u>capital gains/losses or reinvestment income</u>
- Simple yield:
  - take <u>discount and premium</u> into consideration, they are eliminating eventually close to maturity
  - Calculation: [annual coupon payment +(-) straight line amortization of a discount(premium)]/flat price
- callable bond:
  - the yield depends on when and where the bond is called.
  - yield-to-call: can be calculated for each possible call date and price
  - yield-to-worst: min(yield-to-maturity & various yield-to-call)
- option-adjusted yield:
  - add call option value to bond's current flat price

### 2) Yield Measures for Float-Rate Bonds

- the value of Float rate notes(FRN) is <u>more stable</u> than fixed-rate bonds, because of coupon interest rates are reset periodically based on reference rate.

### 3) Yield Measures for Money Market Instrument

## 4. Yield Curves

## 5. Yield Spreads

- Definition:
  - difference between yields of two different bonds, in form of basis points(bps)
  - used to analyze factors that affect a bond's yield
    - check whether it is *macroeconomic* factors or *microeconomic*(firm- or industry- specific) factors
      - macro: the factors affect <u>real risk-free rate, expected inflation</u>
      - micro: factors affect <u>credit and liquidity risk premium</u> by Fisher effect
- Benchmark spread
  - bond yield & benchmark bond yield *with same maturity*
  - Also called *G-spread*, using government bond
  - benchmark can be: on-the-run government bond yields
  - benchmark may change during bond's life
- Interpolated spread
  - use rates for interest rate swaps in the *same currency* with the same tenor票据的限期
  - also called *I-spread*
  - frequently stated for bonds denominated in *euros*
- Disadvantage of G-spread and I-spread:
  - theoretically correct only if the <u>spot curve</u> is flat, yields are 大致same across maturity
  - While, in reality, spot yield curve is <u>upward-sloping</u>
    - longer-term yield higher than lower-term yield
- Zero-Volatility spread <https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zspread.asp>
  - also called *Z-spread*
  - make the price of security=PV of its CF when added to yield at each point on Treasury spot rate curve
  - each CF is discounted at proper Treasury spot rate + Z-spread=market price of the bond
- option-adjusted spread(OAS)
  - used for bonds with embedded options
  - take option yield out of Z-spread measure
  - Calculation:
    - option value=Z-spread - OAS
    - OAS=Z-spread - option value
