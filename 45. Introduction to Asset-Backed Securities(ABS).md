# Reading 45 Introduction to Asset-Backed Securities(ABS)

## 1. Mortgage-Backed Securities Structure

### 1) Benefits of Securitization for Economics and Financial Markets

- Definition of Securitization:
  - financial assets purchased by entity which <u>issues securities supported by cash flows</u> from those financial assets
- Primary Benefits:
  - reduction on funding costs
  - liquidity of underlying assets increases
- Traditional structure for investors get exposure to bank mortgage loans:
  - invest in bank deposits, bank debt securities, banks common equity
- Beyond traditional structure, the benefits of Securitization:
  - *reduce intermediation costs*, leading to lower funding costs for borrowers, <u>higher risk-adjusted return</u> for lenders
    - while, the intermediary is still required for <u>package and distribute securities</u>
  - investors' legal claim is stronger
  - provides *diversification and risk reduction* compared to whole loans
  - securities are actively traded, <u>bank asset liquidity</u> increase
  - bank can lend more, because bank has <u>received the proceeds</u>, loan monitoring and collection↑
  - lead to <u>financial innovation</u>, owing to it allows investors to invest in securities that better match preferred risk, maturity, and required return.更合适

### 2) Describe Parties Securitization

- Basic structure of Securitization transaction
- 银行通过放贷来收取proceeds，以此来放更多的贷款, by selling loan portfolio to **special purpose entity(SPE)**, called <u>Auto Loan Trust</u>
  - SPE:
    - buy auto loans & sell ABS to investors
    - can be treated as *trust and issuer*, a separate legal entity of Fred
    - the loan portfolio is <u>collateral</u> for ABS
- Parties & Functions:
  - Customer buy cars---->Fred(seller, depositor)--(loans)-->Auto Loan Trust, SPE--(ABS)-->investors
  - Fred(Server) services the loans
  - sometimes, servers and sellers are not the same one
- Mortgage-backed securities(MBS): when loans owned by SPE(trust) are mortgages, we called the securities like that.
- The <u>credit rating of ABS is higher</u> than that of other bonds issued by Fred.
  - *cost to fund loans* using ABS structure < if Fred issues other corporate bonds

### 3) Typical Structures(Credit Tranching & Time Tranching)

- *multiple classes* of securities with different claim to cash flows of the underlying assets， called **tranches**.
  - risk is redistributed, total risk unchanged
- **Credit Tranching**
  - have different *exposures to risk* of default asset underlying the ABS
  - **Senior+Subordinated Structure**次级结构 or **waterfall structure**: absorb转移 credit losses when it occur up to its principle amount
  - subordinate bonds <u>proportion</u>↑, level of protection for senior tranche↑
  - Rule: smaller proportion, *earlier* loss tranche, until reach up to principle amount
- **Time Tranching**
  - Rule: <u>first tranche</u> receive all principle repayments up to principle. Then comes to <u>second tranche</u>...
  - it reallocates prepayment risk, <u>contraction risk</u>收缩风险(receive principle payment sooner than expected) or <u>extension risk</u>(later than expected)延期风险
    - 规律：the first has greatest contraction risk; While, the later sequential tranches have less contraction risks but more extension risks.
    - contraction risk more likely to occur when interest rate *decline*
    - extension risk more likely to occur when interest rate *increases*
- Both of tranches can be included in the same structure.

### 4) Securitized Residential Mortgage Loans Characteristics(RMBS)

- Residential mortgage loans: the underlying collateral of the loans is <u>residential real estate</u>.
- classification by credit quality of borrowers in US:
  - prime loans: borrowers with higher credit quality
  - subprime loans次级贷款: borrowers with lower credit quality, OR lower-priority claim to collateral in event of default
- Characteristic:
  - **Loan-to-Value Ratio(LTV)**:
    - Definition: the percentage value of the collateral real state that is *loaned* to the borrower.
    - LTV↓, borrower's equity in property↑, risky of lender↓, probability of lender to <u>recover the amount loaned</u> when defaults occur and <u>repossesses and sells</u> the property↑
      - because borrowers have more to lose in event of default, the probability to default get smaller.
  - Maturity
    - term: time until final loan payment is made
    - In US, usually in 15~30 years; Europe: ~50 years; Japan: up to 100 years
  - Determination of Interest Rates
    - fixed-rate mortgage: interest rate unchanged
    - adjustable-rate mortgage(variable-rate mortgage): interest rate changes over life of mortgage
    - index-referenced mortgage: interest rate changed related to a market determined reference rate(LIBOR, or 1-year US Treasury bill rate...)
    - hybrid mortgage: interest rate is fixed initially, then be variable-rate mortgage later.
    - rollover(renegotiable) mortgage: fixed initially, then changes to a different fixed rate.两个不同fixed rate的
    - convertible mortgage:原本的fixed变variable-rate，或者原本的variable-rate变成fixed
  - Amortization Principle
    - fully amortizing loan:
      - components of each mortgage payment: interest payment + some of loan principle repayment
      - *no loan principle* remaining after last regular payment
      - when there is a <u>fixed payment</u>, in the beginning of loan term: *large interest* component+small principle repayment component.While, at the end of loan terms, the situation in reverse.
    - partially amortizing loan:
      - loan repayments include some principle repayment.
      - Balloon Payment: a <u>lump sum of principle remained</u> to be paid the end of loan period一次付清剩余的本金借贷
      - interest-only mortgage:
        - no principle repayment
        - the balloon payment is original principle amount
        - it can be *lifetime* interest-only(*Bullet mortgage*) or *initial time* interest-only.
  - Prepayment Provisions预付款条款
    - prepayment definition: if partial or full repayment of principle > scheduled principle repayments
      - motivations:
        - reduce outstanding principle
        - reduce interest charge
        - pay off loans prior to maturity
    - some loans have **prepayment penalty**(additional payment)
      - provide compensation for lenders when the <u>mortgages are paid off early</u>, because market interest rates ↓ since the mortgage life time begins
        - loans refinanced at a lower interest rate
    - Cases:
      - if homeowners *sell home* during mortgage term, remaining principle repayment is required
      - homeowners *refinance* her mortgages prepays the remaining of principle, using <u>new lower interest rate loan's</u> proceeds收益.
  - Rights of Lenders in Event of Defaults, Foreclosure丧失抵押品赎回权
    - non-recourse loans:无追索权贷款
      - lender has no claim against any other assets of borrowers except the collateral property.
      - it guarantee the borrowers never losing more than the actual asset.
      - most mortgage loans are non-recourse loans
      - strategic default: if outstanding loan principle > home value, borrowers voluntarily return the property to lenders
    - recourse loans追索贷款
      - lender has claim a shortfalls(outstanding mortgage balance-after property sold) from borrowers
      - if borrowers have other assets, he can choose to sell them out to fulfill the shortfalls
      - allow lenders to pursuit more than collateral assets, but sometimes lenders even not try to do it, owing to time consumptions
    - the proceeds from sell the properties may < outstanding mortgage balance, and not enough to recover the losses

### 5) Mortgage Pass-Through Securities

- Agency RMBS: 
  - Issuers: issued by Government National Mortgage Association(GNMA), <u>Fannie Mae(FNMA), Freddie Mac</u>(the underlying are government-sponsored enterprises) with high credit quality
  - they are *Mortgage Pass-Through Securities*
    - represent a claim on cash flows from <u>pool of mortgage</u>
    - quantity of securities composing the pool is not limited
    - any mortgage *included in the pool* is considered as *securtized mortgage*, with <u>different maturities and mortgage rates</u>.
      - Weighted average maturity(WAM) of the pool: weighted by <u>each outstanding principle balance</u>/total outstanding principle value of all mortgage
      - Weighted average coupon(WAC): depends on interest rates
    - investment characteristics are function of <u>cash flow features & guarantee provided strength</u>
    - the **criteria** for mortgage included in pool as <u>conforming loans</u>:
      - minimum percentage down payment
      - maximum LTV ratio
      - maximum size
      - minimum documentation required
      - insurance purchased by borrowers
    - investors receives monthly *cash flows generated* by mortgages pools - service and guarantee or insurance *fees*
      - the fees are related to **pass-through rates**, also called *net interest* or *net coupon*
      - the timing of cash passed through to investors != that of cash flow generated from pool
    - without prepayment penalty
- While, the loans do not meet the criteria above, called *non-conforming loans*
  - they are securitized by private companies for <u>non-agency RMBS</u>

## 2. Prepayment Risk & Non-Mortgage-Backed ABS

### 1) Prepayment Risk

- Definition:
  - the characteristic of pass-through securities
  - measurement:
    - Single monthly mortality rate(SMM)
      - monthly based
      - Calculation: SMM=prepayment for a month/beginning mortgage balance for month-scheduled principle repayment
      - higher SMM, higher prepayment
    - conditional prepayment rate(CPR)
      - annualized SMM
      - factors affect CPR:
        - loan pool weighted average coupon rate
        - current interest rates
        - prior principle prepayment
  - PSA prepayment benchmark:
    - monthly CPR increased as its ages
    - expressed as monthly series of CPR
    - if CPR=PSA benchmark-->PSA=100, that is, 100% of benchmark CPR
  - Weighted average life:
    - Definition: expected number of years until <u>all loan principle is repaid</u>
    - However, because of *prepayment*, average life of MBS < weighted average maturity.[the effect]
    - usually, high PSA=400(600), reduce average life of MBS=4.5(3.2) yr; PSA=100, average life of MBS=11 yr
- Collateralized Mortgage Obligations(CMO)
  - Definition: securities collateralized by RMBS, with multiple <u>bond classes(tranches)</u> which have different exposures to prepayment risk.(securities secured by other securities)
    - backed by <u>mortgage pass-through securities</u>
  - traits: better matches investors preference金融产品种类更丰富 with different mixture of contraction and extension risk, reduce funding costs
  - Types:
    - Sequential Pay CMO
      - separate cash flows into tranches which retired sequentially with a coupon rate
      - *short tranche* matures first, more protection against <u>extension risk</u>
      - Principle payment=scheduled payment + estimated prepayments based on prepayment rate
    - Planned Amortization Class(PAC) CMO
      - aim: make predictable payments, regardless of actual prepayment
      - effect: reduce both contraction and extension risk
        - Solution:
          - increase prepayment risk of CMO's **support tranches**, which <u>provide or absorb</u> prepayment起到一个rebalanced的作用,风险转移了
            - support tranches have <u>higher interest rates</u> than PAC tranches
            - support tranches also called `non-PAC tranches`
            - PAC tranches with <u>lower volatility of average life</u>, enjoying less prepayment risk than support tranches.
              - if prepayment *decreases or speed fall*, average life of support tranche > that of PAC I tranche
                - support tranche with higher <u>extension risk</u>
              - if prepayment *increases or speed rise*, average life of support tranche < that of PAC I tranche
                - support tranche with higher <u>contraction risk</u>
            - **initial PAC collar**: upper and lower bounds on actual prepayment rates which support tranches take effects.
              - normally bounds given $\in [100,300]$ PSA, average life of PAC I tranche=6.5 yr
              - if the actual PSA outside the given bounds, it is called **broken PAC**
          - support tranches relative to PAC ↑, probability PAC cash flow *differs* from scheduled payments ↓
    - Non-agency RMBS
      - not guaranteed by government
      - the credit quality factors:
        - credit quality of borrowers
        - characteristics of loans(eg: LTV ratios)
      - **credit enhancement** to obtain favorable credit rating:
        - External: an investment grade, includes third party guarantee
        - Internal:
          - shifting interest mechanism, senior/subordinate structure
          - cash reverse funds
          - overcollateralization
          - excess spread accounts
      - 2 factors forecasting non-agency RMBS future cash flows:
        - collateral default rate
        - recovery rate: some part of mortgage may be *seized then sold*
    - Floating rate tranches

### 2) Commercial Mortgage-backed Securities(CMBS)

- Definition of CMBS: backed by income-producing real estate
  - eg: apartment, shopping center, office-building, healthcare facilities, hotel...
- Difference between CBMS and RMBS: borrowers obligation of underlying loans
  - RMBS:
    - repaid by homeowners
    - it can be recourse loans
  - CMBS: 
    - repaid by real estate investors. And they rely on tenants房客 and customers to provide CFs to repay
    - Non-recourse loans
- Credit risk:
  - focus on the property, not on the borrowers
  - 2 key ratios
    - **debt service coverage ratio**=net operating income/debt service cost
      - debt service=annual interest and principle payment
      - amount of CF from commercial properties available to make debt service payment, compared to required debt service costs
      - NOI: after real estate tax deduction, before income taxes deduction
        - NOI=rental income-cash operating expenses-non-cash replacement reserve
      - normal range $\in [1,2]$
        - higher, more protection to lender, the better
        - if <1, insufficient cash flow, likely to be default
    - **loan-to-value ratio(LTV)**=current mortgage amount/current appraised value
      - compare property loan amount to current fair market value
      - the lower the better
- Structures:
  - goal: to meet investors' different return and risk needs, with different credit rating by Moody or S&P, CMBS divided into several tranches with *specific repayment sequence*.
    - higher priority tranches with higher credit quality
    - default loss firstly absorbed by tranches <u>with lower priority</u>.
  - most-junior tranche最底层 is not rated, referred to as <u>equity tranche, residual tranche, or first-loss tranche</u>.
  - for fixed-rate securities, *call protection* is valuable for bondholders
    - for MBS, call protection≈prepayment projection, restriction on early return of principle
    - Approaches: <u>individual mortgages terms</u>(loan level) or by <u>CMBS structure</u>
    - ways for creating loan-level call protection:
      - prepayment lockout: a specific time period(2~5 yrs) investors are prohibited from mortgage loan prepayment
      - defeasance解除负担:
        - if the borrowers *insist in making principle payments* on mortgage loans, it will be defeased.
        - approach: use prepaid principle to <u>purchase a government securities</u> portfolio which is sufficient to *make remaining required payments* on CMBS.
        - the credit quality of CMBS pool↑
      - prepayment penalty points: each point is 1% of principle amount prepaid. fixed rate
      - yield maintenance charges:
        - also called `make-whole charge`
        - borrowers pay a penalty to lender that making *refinancing uneconomical* which gets <u>lower mortgage rate</u>.
        - to make lenders indifferent to prepayment
- Ballon Risk:
  - Reason: CMBS's amortization schedule > loan term
  - at the end of loan term, the loan still <u>has principle outstanding need to be paid</u>. If borrowers cannot arrange refinancing, it is *in default*.
  - then borrowers are forced to extend loan term with a higher interest rate.
  - a kind of *extension risk*

### 3) Types of Non-Mortgage Asset-Backed Securities

- Auto Loan ABS
  - fully amortizing
  - backed by loans for automobiles
  - maturities $\in (36,72)$ months
  - issuers: auto manufacturers financial subsidiaries, commercial bank, credit union, finance companies
  - cash flow components: interest payment, scheduled principle payment, prepayments
    - prepay:
      - if cars are sold, traded in, or repossessed第二手(旧货)的
      - when car is stolen or wrecked
  - credit enhancement:
    - senior+subordinated structure, a junior tranche absorbs credit risk
    - reserve account
      - protect bondholders against losses up to x% of the par value
    - excess interest spread:
      - surplus difference between <u>interest received by ABS issuer & interest paid to holder</u>
      - remaining interest payments, after all expenses are covered
    - over-collateralization超额抵押(OC)
      - absorbs credit risk, risk reduction
      - Calculation: aggregate auto loan contract principle balance - notes principle balance
      - OC ratio=collateral value/loan value, normal range is $\in (10\%, 20\%)$
      - it is achieved when *value of assets in pool > amount of ABS*
  - prime loans and subprime loans
- Credit Card ABS
  - non-amortizing
  - backed by pools of credit card debt owed to banks, retailers, travel and entertainment companies.
  - cash flow of credit card receivable: finance charges, annual fees, principle payments, late payment fees
    - finance charge: <u>periodic interest</u> the borrowers is charged on *unpaid balance* after grace period
  - lockout period:
    - *interest payment* are made monthly, quarterly..., but <u>without principle repayment</u> to ABS holders.
      - interest rate can be fixed or floated
    - duration time period: 18 months ~ 10yrs after ABS created
    - While, credit card holders make principle payment during lockout period:
      - goal: keep receivable pool constant, by using these money <u>purchasing additional credit card receivables</u>

### 4) Collateralized Debt Obligation(CDO)

- Definition: a structured securities issued by SPE, collateral is a pool of debt obligation
- Collateralized Bond Obligation(CBO): are *corporate or emerging market* debt
- Collateralized loan obligation(CLO): support by leveraged <u>bank loans</u>(personal loans from bank) portfolio.
- collateral manager of CDO: buy/sell securities in the pool for generating cash to make promised payments to investors.
- Structured finance CDOs: whose collaterals are ABS, RMBS, CMBS
- Synthetic CDOs合成的，人造的: whose collateral is a portfolio of **credit default swaps**(CDS)
  - CDS: value↓, credit quality of reference securities↑
- Class of bonds(tranches):senior, mezzanine, subordinated(residual/equity) bonds
- Structure:
  - Class of bonds(tranches):senior, mezzanine, subordinated(residual/equity) bonds 
  - issue a <u>float-rate senior tranche</u>, *70%~80%* of total or a *mezzanine tranche* pay a <u>fixed-rate</u> interest
  - when environment changing rates, enter into an <u>interest rate swap</u>: fixed rate-->floating rate, making collateral yield closely match with funding costs.
    - Arbitrage CDO: earn returns from the spread between funding costs and portfolio returns.

### 5) Covered Bonds

- Definition:
  - segregated underlying assets remain on balance sheet of the issuing corporation.
  - no SPE
  - issued primarily by <u>European and Asian</u> Financial institution
- Traits:
  - special laws protection for asset in the cover pool, when firms are in bankruptcy and insolvency
  - provide <u>recourse</u>, increasing credit quality, with lower yields compared with ABS
  - no structured with tranches, pool *is not fixed* at issuance
    - issuers replace <u>nonperforming or prepaid assets</u>, providing *promised interest and principle payments*
- Different provisions according to issuers default:
  - Hard-bullet covered bond: if issuers fail to make scheduled payment, it is in default.
  - Soft-bullet covered bond: 推迟originally scheduled maturity date <=1 yr
  - Conditional pass-through covered bond: if any payments remain, converts to pass-through bonds.
