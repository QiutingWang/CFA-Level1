# Reading 46 Understanding Fixed Income Risk and Return

## 1. Source of Returns, Duration

### 1) Source of Return from Fixed-rate Bond

- 3 Sources:
  - coupon and principle payment received on scheduled dates
  - gain/loss for bond sold prior to maturity
  - interest earned on *reinvested* over holding period coupon payment. As `interest on interest`
    - Definition of Reinvestment:
      - use dividend, interest, or other form of income distribution earnings to *purchase additional financial instrument*
      - rather than receiving cash distributions
- Assumptions:
  - the reinvested earning rate=YTM
  - no addressing credit risk, making all promised interest and principle payment
- 4 Results:
  - investors hold fixed-rate bond will earn annualized rate of return==YTM when purchased
  - investors who sell a bond *prior to maturity* earn a rate of return == YTM at purchased, if YTM is not changed since purchase.
    - based on carrying value, we can get capital gain/loss
  - if market YTM, assumed reinvestment rate, increase/decrease *after purchasing the bond but before the first coupon date*, a buy-and-hold investor's realized return will be *higher/lower* than YTM of bond when purchased.
    - Explain: if reinvestment rate↑, coupon payment and reinvestment income↑, holding period's required rate of return↑ > YTM at purchase
      - 数值取值holding period's required rate of return: between YTM at purchase & assumed reinvestment rate(also called changed YTM)
  - ...., increase/decrease.., a bond investor will earn a rate of return < YTM at bond purchase if the bond is held for a *short/long period*.**[the relationship between investment horizon length & changes of return rate before the first coupon rate]**
    - short investment horizon: market price risk>reinvestment risk  比较care YTM市场波动率
      - yield↑, rate of return required for one-year period↓, sales price↓
    - long investment horizon: reinvestment risk>market price risk 可预见性太弱了
      - market price risk: uncertainty about price results from <u>uncertainty about market YTM</u>
      - reinvestment risk: uncertainty about *total coupon payments and reinvestment earnings* results from uncertainty about <u>future reinvestment rate</u>.
- Annualized Holding Period Rate of Return:(HPR)
  - compound annual return earned from the bond over holding period
  - based on purchase price of bond
  - Elements we cared about:
    - reinvestment income and coupon income=FV of annuity of coupon payment(@coupon rate), multiply the interest rate for time value$\sum_{i=1}^n principle*couponRate*(1+interestRate)^{i-1}$
    - reinvestment earnings: $reinvestmentIncome-n*couponPayment$ 
    - investor rate of return over n-year holding period=((reinvestment income + maturity value)/purchase price)^(1/n)-1
    - we can prove the results above.

### 2) Three Durations

- Macaulay Duration(MacDur)
  - Duration Definition:
    - measure of bond <u>interest risk</u> or sensitivity of *bond's full price* to a change in its *yield*
  - calculation:
    - Rule: weighted average of numbers of years until each bond's promised cash flows is to be paid
      - weight=(PV of each cash flow/PV of bond's full value)*100%
      - denominator includes PV of each period coupon payment and principle repayment
      - function: Macaulay Duration=$\sum_{i=1}^{n}W_i*i$
  - Evaluation: not the best measurement for interest rate sensitivity
  - 变化规律: between two coupon dates, the duration decreases with passage of time, then goes back up dramatically at coupon payment date.
- Modified Duration(also called ModDur):
  - function: Macaulay Duration/(1+YTM)
  - the $\Delta \%$ price=-ModDur*$\Delta$YTM
    - Note: YTM的单位本来就是percentage
    - linear relationship, making good estimate when changes are small in yield
  - for annualized bond: $ModDur=MacDur/(1+YTM)$
  - for semi-annual bond: $ModDur_{semi}=MacDur_{semi}/(1+YTM/2)$
- Approximate Modified Duration
  - function: $AMD=\frac{V_{-}- V_+}{2*V_0*\Delta YTM}$
    - $V_{-}$: bond's price if YTM decreased by $\Delta$ YTM
    - $V_{+}$: bond's price if YTM increased by $\Delta$ YTM
    - $V_{-}>V_{+}$
    - $V_0$: bond's current price
  - *Convexity* of price-yield relationship: price increase to $V_{-}$, for a given $\Delta$ YTM, >> price decrease to $V_{+}$
  - take average of magnitude of price increase and price decrease, then use $\Delta$YTM change into percentage
    - $\Delta$ YTM=50bps, that is, 0.5% changes in percentage
    - 100bps-->1%
- Effective Duration
  - useful for bonds with embedded options, eg: putable bond, callable bond, mortgage-backed bond, which are related to *benchmark yield curve*.
    - not care about changes yield spread for credit and liquidity risk
    - with uncertain future cash flows depending on path of interest rate changes
    - mortgage-backed bond
      - with <u>prepayment option</u>
      - when interest rate↓, the prepayment accelerate
  - Calculation: $ED=\frac{V_{-}- V_+}{2*V_0*\Delta curve}$
  - Evaluation:
    - not provide better price estimations for *small yield changes*. 
    - The larger yield changes, the more predictable for prepayment or calls.
  - for callable bonds, ED measures become lowest among these durations.

## 2. Interest Rate Risk and Money Duration

### 1) Key Rate Duration

- also called <u>partial duration</u>
- the measurement takes impact of <u>non-parallel shift in yield curve</u> into consideration
- sensitivity of *portfolio or bond value to spot rate changes* for <u>a given maturity</u>
  - evaluating various *segments* of the yield curve
  - the effect on portfolio is calculated by sum of individual effects for each maturity
  - graph: maturity range & key rate duration
- sum of bond's key rate durations == effective duration

### 2) Factors Affect Interest Rate Risk

- Maturity
  - usually maturity↑, interest rate risk↑
  - *PV of payments* which made *further in future* changes are more *sensitive* to discount rate changes than sooner
- Coupon Rate
  - coupon rate↑, interest rate risk↓, bond less sensitive to yield changes
    - more of bond's value will be from payment received sooner
- Yield YTM
  - yield↑, interest rate risk↓
  - proved by price-yield curve, lower yields, price is more sensitive to yield changes
- Additional put/call options for option-free bond:
  - interest rate risk↓, interest rate risk↓, calculated by effective duration 
    - with call provision, value of call↑ as yields ↓

### 3) Portfolio Duration

- Two Approaches to Calculate:
  - calculate weighted average # of periods until portfolio's cash flows will be received
    - 理论上成立，但不常用
    - use **cash flow yield**, the *IRR* of the portfolio
    - it *doesn't work* for a portfolio that contains bonds *with embedded options*, which has uncertain cash flows
  - calculate weighted average of portfolio's individual bonds' durations
    - Typically used in practice
    - make it possible for measuring portfolio with *bonds embedded with options* by effective durations
    - Calculation: $portfolio \space duration=W_1D_1+W_2D_2+...+W_ND_N$
      - $D_i$: duration of bond i
      - $W_i$: full price of bond i/portfolio total value
    - Limitation:
      - must under `parallel shift` assumption in yield curve
      - YTM of every bond in portfolio must change in same amount

### 4) Money Duration & Price Value of a Basic Point(PVBP)

- Money Duration(also called dollar duration)
  - Expression: Money Duration=Annual Modified Duration * Full Price of Bond Position
  - also can be expressed as <u>money duration per 100 of bond par value</u>=...*full bond price per 100 of par value
- Money Duration * change in YTM=bond value change
- PVBP:
  - average money change(decrease & increase) in full price of bond when YTM changes(increase & decrease) by 1bps(0.01%)
    - $(V_{-}-V_{+})/2$

## 3. Convexity and Yield Volatility

### 1) Approximate and Effective Convexity

- bond price falls <u>at a decreasing rate</u> as yields increase
- Bond's Approximate Convexity=$\frac{V_{-}+V_{+}-2V_0}{(\Delta YTM)^2V_0}$
- Effective Convexity=$\frac{V_{-}+V_{+}-2V_0}{(\Delta curve)^2V_0}$
  - used for bond embedded with options
- longer maturity, lower coupon rate, lower YTM, dispersed cash flow over time, greater convexity.
- the convexity for any option-free bond >0, convexity of a **callable bond** < 0 at low yield
  - difference between option-free bond & callable bond=value of call option
  - for convexity<0, price increase from a decrease in YTM < price decrease from increase in YTM
    - reason: at lower yield, <u>calls</u> are more valuable. Call price put limit effect on bond value increase.对债券增值有压抑作用
    - Y: price(%par); X: yield
    - price fall at an increasing rate斜率不断增大
- **putable bond** has <u>greater convexity</u> than option-free bond,对于putable斜率减小的更快
  - the difference between putable bond and option-free bond=value of put-option
  - at higher yield, the <u>put</u> becomes more valuable.-->value of putable bond decrease given a increase of YTM < that of option-free bond

### 2) Calculate Percentage Change of Bond Price

- Change in full bond price= - annual ModDur × $\Delta YTM$+$\frac{1}{2}$ annual convexity × $(\Delta YTM)^2$
  - convexity adjustments for both ↑/↓ in yield are the same.
- good for estimating large change in yield

### 3) The Effect of Term Structure Yield Volatility on Bond Interest Rate Risk

- term structure yield volatility: relationship between volatility of bonds yield & times to maturity
- components of bond price volatility:
  - bond yield volatility
  - sensitivity of bond price to a given change in yield价格对yield敏感度
- <u>shorter-term bond with a greater volatility</u> than a longer-term bond

### 4) Relationship among Bond's HPR, Duration, and Investment Horizon

- MacDur application: match bond to investor investment horizon
  - if they are matched, <u>a parallel shift</u> in yield curve *prior to first coupon payment* won't affect investor return.
- <u>increase in yield</u> prior to first coupon date:
  - reduce horizon yield for a short investment horizon
  - increase horizon yield for a *long investment horizon*负面影响不大
    - increase in reinvestment income from yield increasing >> decrease of sale price-->their exist an reinvestment earning
- decrease in yield:
  - for short investment horizon project, have *capital gain* and small decrease in reinvestment income负面影响不大
  - for long investment horizon project, be more affected by reinvestment income decreases, horizon return < bond original yield
- For **MacDur**==Investor Investment Horizon: the effect on <u>sale price and reinvestment income</u> will be *offset* each other
  - market price risk & reinvestment risk are offset each other
- Duration Gap: difference between <u>MacDur and bondholder investment horizon</u>
  - Duration Gap>0: market price risk results from interest rate increasing
  - Duration Gap<0: reinvestment risk from interest rates decreasing
  - ❗️if it is not compared with MacDur but other durations, we need to convert current duration to MacDur

### 5) Effects of Credit Spread and Liquidity Changes on YTM & Estimate Price Effect of the Change

- components of interest rates of *benchmark yield curve*:
  - real rate of return
  - expected inflation
- components of bond's spread to benchmark curve:
  - credit risk premium
  - premium from <u>lack of liquidity</u> relative to benchmark securities
    - less liquidity, larger yield spread
- Formula: $\% \Delta bond \space value=-duration(\Delta spread)+\frac{1}{2}convexity(\Delta spread)^2$
  - 公式的演变：the effect of each yield component are additive together by YTM 将full price change公式中YTM替代为spread

### 6) Empirical Duration & Analytical Duration

- Analytical Duration: calculated by mathematical analysis
- Empirical Duration: estimate by historical relationship between <u>benchmark yield changes and bond price changes</u>
  - if the following assumption not hold: changes in *benchmark yield curve* and *bond yield* spread are uncorrelated.-->empirical duration is appropriate
