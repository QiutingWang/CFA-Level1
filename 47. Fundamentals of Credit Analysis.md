# Reading 47 Fundamentals of Credit Analysis

## 1. Credit Risk & Bond Ratings

### 1) Credit Risk, Credit-Related Risk, Components

- Credit Risk: loss stemming from borrowers' failure to make full and timely payments of interest and principle
- Components:
  - default risk: probability a borrower fails to pay interests or principle repayment when due
  - loss severity
    - also called: *loss given default*
    - definition: value a bond investor will lose, if the issuer defaults.
    - expressed as monetary amount or percentage on bond value
- Related Concepts:
  - expected loss=default risk * loss severity
    - can be expressed as percentage or monetary amount
  - recovery rate: percentage of bond value an investor will receive, if issuer defaults
    - expected loss=1-recovery rate
  - yield spread:
    - Definition: difference in yield between <u>credit-risky bond and risk-free bond</u> with similar maturity
    - reversely related to bond price
    - the size of yield spread reflect:
      - issuer's creditworthiness
      - the bond market liquidity
    - **Spread Risk**:
      - Definition: possibility that bond's spread will widen
      - Factors:
        - Credit migration risk, or Downgrade risk: spread increase due to <u>issuers become less creditworthy</u>
        - Market liquidity risk:
          - Definition: the risk of receiving less than market value when selling a bond
          - reflected in **bid-ask spread**
          - reasons:
            - issuers with less creditworthy
            - Size of issuer: small bond issuers with relative little publicly traded debt.

### 2) Seniority Ranking, Potential Priority Violation in Bankruptcy

- priority of claims: when in default, for same issuers, each category of debt is ranked.
- Seniority Ranking:
  - Definition: bonds' priority of claims to issuer's <u>assets and cash flows</u>
  - can be used for <u>secured or unsecured debt</u>. *Secured debt* has *higher priority*.
  - General Rankings: ❤️ first lien/senior secured→second lien/secured→senior unsecured→senior subordinated→subordinated→junior subordinated
    - first lien: when specific asset is pledged
    - higher priority of claims, higher recovery rate of debt, lower credit risk, lower required yield from investor
    - in event of default or bankruptcy:
      - strictly priority of claims not always applied in practice
      - lower priority debt holders, even equity holders may get paid, 即使senior debt holders are not repaid in full.
        - reasons: 
          - <u>negotiation and compromise</u> among different claimholders for giving reorganization plan quickly.
  - Special Case: **Rank Pari Passu**: all debt within the same category, having same priority of claims
