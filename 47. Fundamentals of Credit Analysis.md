# Reading 47 Fundamentals of Credit Analysis

## 1. Credit Risk & Bond Ratings

### 1) Credit Risk, Credit-Related Risk, Components

- Credit Risk: loss stemming from borrowers' failure to make full and timely payments of interest and principle
- Components:
  - default risk: probability a borrower fails to pay interests or principle repayment when due
  - loss severity
    - also called: *loss given default*
    - definition: value a bond investor will lose, if the issuer defaults.
    - expressed as monetary amount or percentage on bond value
- Related Concepts:
  - expected loss=default risk * loss severity
    - can be expressed as percentage or monetary amount
  - recovery rate: percentage of bond value an investor will receive, if issuer defaults
    - expected loss=1-recovery rate
  - yield spread:
    - Definition: difference in yield between <u>credit-risky bond and risk-free bond</u> with similar maturity
    - reversely related to bond price
    - the size of yield spread reflect:
      - issuer's creditworthiness
      - the bond market liquidity
    - **Spread Risk**:
      - Definition: possibility that bond's spread will widen
      - Factors:
        - Credit migration risk, or Downgrade risk: spread increase due to <u>issuers become less creditworthy</u>
        - Market liquidity risk:
          - Definition: the risk of receiving less than market value when selling a bond
          - reflected in **bid-ask spread**
          - reasons:
            - issuers with less creditworthy
            - Size of issuer: small bond issuers with relative little publicly traded debt.

### 2) Seniority Ranking, Potential Priority Violation in Bankruptcy

- priority of claims: when in default, for same issuers, each category of debt is ranked.
- Seniority Ranking:
  - Definition: bonds' priority of claims to issuer's <u>assets and cash flows</u>
  - can be used for <u>secured or unsecured debt</u>. *Secured debt* has *higher priority*.
  - General Rankings: ❤️ first lien/senior secured→second lien/secured→senior unsecured→senior subordinated→subordinated→junior subordinated
    - first lien: when specific asset is pledged
    - higher priority of claims, higher recovery rate of debt, lower credit risk, lower required yield from investor
    - in event of default or bankruptcy:
      - strictly priority of claims not always applied in practice
      - lower priority debt holders, even equity holders may get paid, 即使senior debt holders are not repaid in full.
        - reasons: 
          - <u>negotiation and compromise</u> among different claimholders for giving reorganization plan quickly.
  - Special Case: **Rank Pari Passu**: all debt within the same category, having same priority of claims 

### 3) Credit Rating Categories

- Rating的对象：issuer & the debt issues & bond itself
- **Corporate Family Ratings(CFR)**:
  - **issuer** credit ratings
  - based on the overall company creditworthiness
  - issuers are based on <u>senior unsecured debt</u>
- **Corporate Credit Ratings(CCR)**:
  - issue-specific rating
  - take <u>seniority ranking and capital structure</u> into consideration
- 3 major credit rating agencies: Moody, S&P, Fitch
- investment grade: >=Baa3 or BBB-
  - the highest: Aaa or AAA
  - with lower default risk
  - focus more on <u>timeliness</u>
- non-investment grade: <= Ba1 or BB+
  - also called *high yield bond*, or *junk bonds*
  - with higher default risk
  - focus more on <u>recovery weights</u>
- Default Rating: both are lowest level, under Fitch and S&P, **D**; under Moody, **C**.
  - <u>Cross default provision</u> in bond indenture trigger *default on remaining issues*.
    - a default on one issue *triggers default on other issues* with same default probability
    - when it triggers, lenders has right to refuse more loan installments under existing contract
- Additional rating indicator: outlook
  - positive/stable/negative
- Notching:
  - Definition: assignment of <u>individual issue ratings</u> that are higher/lower than that of <u>issuers rating</u>
  - firm individual bonds rating != corporate(issuer) rating
  - <u>less common to highly-rated issuers</u> than lower-rated issuers
  - for firm with *speculative credit*, subordinated debt might be <u>notched 2 ratings below</u> its issuers' rating.
  - rating moves up/down by notch based on <u>default risk or severity loss</u>
- Factors the rating issuers consider while assigning rates:
  - probability of default
  - priority of payment, seniority ranking
  - covenants
  - structural subordination
    - when both parent and subsidiaries have outstanding debt
    - there exists a restriction to limit transferring subsidiaries' cash or assets to parents-->子公司可以用自己的钱优先满足bond claims, than satisfy parents company
    - occurs when issuer is operating company, not holding company

### 4) Risk in Relying on Ratings from Agencies

- credit rating are dynamic: higher credit ratings tend to *be more stable* than lower credit ratings.
- rating agencies are not perfect:
  - rating mistakes occur
  - *subprime mortgage loans* assigned *higher ratings* than they deserve.
- event risk is difficult to assess: risk are <u>specific to firm and industry</u> is difficult to predict and combined into credit ratings
- credit ratings lag market pricing:
  - market price and credit spreads change much quicker than credit ratings
  - two bonds with same ratings are traded with different yields

### 5) 4Cs Traditional Credit Analysis

- **Capacity**
  - definition: corporate borrower's ability to repay its debt obligations on time
  - Three levels assessment:
    - industry structure
      - five force: entry threat, power of suppliers, power of customers, substitution threats, rivalry among existing competitors
    - industry fundamentals宏观因素
      - industrial cyclicality
        - cyclical industries have more volatile反覆无常的 revenues, cash flows, more risky than noncyclical industries
      - industrial growth prospects: in slow-growing or declining industry, creditworthiness is most questionable.
      - industry published statistics: there are provided by <u>rating agencies, IBD, industry periodicals, government agency</u>
    - company fundamentals
      - competitive positions: *market share* changes, *cost structures* relative to peers 
      - operating history: performance over *different business cycle phrase*, margin and revenue <u>trends</u>, current management tenures
      - management's strategy and execution:
        - strategy soundness
        - ability of execute strategy
        - effects of management decisions on bondholders
      - ratios analysis: leverage and coverage ratios
- **Collateral**
  - more important for <u>less creditworthy companies</u>
  - issues to consider:
    - intangible assets
      - patent is good quality intangible asset, for generating cash flows
      - goodwill is bad..., usually written down when company performance is poor.
    - depreciation:
      - high depreciation means *low quality assets*, management not investing sufficiently in company
      - lead to reducing operating cash flow, high loss severity
    - equity market capitalization: stock trades< book value, meaning company assets are *low of quality*
    - human and intellectual capital: difficult to value
- **Covenants**契约
  - definition: <u>terms and conditions</u> the borrowers and lenders agree to as *a part of bond issue*
  - 2 types:
    - affirmative covenants
      - ask borrowers to take actions
      - for administrative purpose
      - follow relevant laws and regulations
      - continue current business activities
    - negative covenants:
      - restrict borrowers from taking certain actions
      - impose significant costs on issuers
      - eg:
        - restrictions on dividend payments and stock repurchase
        - restrictions on additional debt amount, measured by <u>maximum debt-to-equity ratio, or minimum interest coverage ratio</u>
        - on M&A, asset sales, company investment
  - drawback effect: restrict operating activities, reducing issuer's ability to repay unduly不适地
- **Character**
  - definition: management integrity and commitment to repay the loan
  - assessment of character analysis:
    - management ability to develop a <u>sound strategy</u>
    - track record: past performance of management executing the strategy, operating without bankruptcy, restructures, or distress situations leading to additional borrowings.
    - accounting policies and tax strategies: eg: revenue recognition, restatement frequency, changing auditors frequently
    - fraud and malfeasance record不法行为,渎职
    - prior treatment of bondholders: put equity holders prior to debt holders, eg: debt-financed acquisitions, leading to *credit rating downgrades, financial distress, and bankruptcy*

## 2. Evaluating Credit Quality

### 1) Financial Ratio Calculate for Credit Analysis and Application

- Rating agencies should publish benchmark values for these values
- Profit and Cash Flow(to service debt) 4 metrics:
  - EBITDA= income + depreciation + amortization
    - drawbacks: without <u>capital expenditure and working capital changes</u> adjustment for going concern
  - Funds from Operations(FFO)
    - FFO=net income from continuing operations + depreciation + amortization + deferred taxes + noncash items
    - excludes <u>changes in working capital</u>, compared with CFO
  - Free Cash Flow Before Dividends
    - =net income + depreciation + amortization - capital expenditures - increasing in working capital
    - excludes non-recurring items
  - Free Cash Flow After Dividends
    - =Free Cash Flow Before Dividends- dividends
    - if it is >0-->cash could *pay down debt*, positive indicator for creditworthiness
- Leverage Ratios
  - Debt/Capital:
    - percentage of capital structure financed by debt
    - lower, less credit risk
  - Debt/EBITDA
    - higher, higher leverage and higher credit risk
    - 更多变对于firm in cyclical industries, or with high operating leverage
  - FFO/debt: higher, lower credit risk
  - FCF after Dividends/debt: higher, greater ability to service existing debt
- Coverage Ratios: measures ability to <u>generate cash flows</u> to meet interest payments
  - EBITDA/interest expense: higher ratios, lower credit risk
    - used more often than another, and higher than another
  - EBIT/interest expense: higher ratios, lower credit risk; more conservations

### 2) Factors Influence Level and Volatility of Yield Spread

- Formula: yield spread=liquidity premium+credit spread
- Corporate bonds' yield spread 5 affecting factors:总的来说，factors向好发展，spread narrower
  - credit cycle
    - overall credit risk is cyclical
      - top of cycle, bond market has *low credit risk*, generally *bullish*
      - <u>credit spread narrows</u>/widens as credit cycle improves/deteriorates
  - economic conditions
    - credit spread narrow, when economy strengthens & investors expects firms credit metrics to improve
  - broker-dealers capital经纪自营商资本:
    - most bond trades over the counter
    - broker-dealers help to <u>provide market-making capital</u> for bonds market
    - yield spreads *narrower*, when broker-dealer provides <u>sufficient capital</u>
  - general market demand and supply
    - credit spread narrows when bond market in <u>high demand</u>
    - 过多的supply, widen credit spread
  - issuers' financial performance
    - positive issuer's credit quality, narrowing and *stabilizing* yield spread

### 3) Special Considerations When Evaluating Credit of High-yield, Sovereign, and Non-Sovereign Government Debt Issuers and Issues

- High-yield debt(non-investment grade)
  - Reasons for non-investment grade: high leverage, unproved operating history, low or negative free cash flow, high sensitivity free cash flow, low management confidence, unclear competitive advantages, larger balance liabilities, industry in decline
  - should be attention on <u>loss severity</u>
  - Special Considerations:
    - liquidity: availability of cash
      - negative factors: bad company-specific news & difficult financial market conditions
      - high yield issuers are limited access to additional borrowings
      - 6 sources: balance sheet cash, working capital, CFO, bank credit, equity issued, assets sales
        - high yield issuers with <u>insufficient sources</u>, large amount of debt within a short time, indicating default; Or with high leverage.
    - financial projections
      - 对象：future earnings and CF
    - debt structure
    - covenants for high yield issuers:
      - change of control put
      - restricted payment
      - limitations on liens
      - restricted VS unrestricted subsidiaries
- Sovereign Debt
  - Basic framework for evaluating and assigning credit rating includes 5 assessments:
    - institutional
    - economic
    - external
    - fiscal
    - monetary
- Non-Sovereign Government Debt
  - issued by local governments and quasi-government entities
