# Reading 48 Derivative Instrument and Derivative Market Features

## 1. Derivative Basic Features

- Definition of Derivative
  - derive its value from the <u>another securities or a variable</u>(called *underlying*) at specific future date
  - a contract to <u>transfer risk</u> from one party to another:
    - price risk转移到buyers
    - derivative issuers has existing risk把衍生品转移出去, has <u>hedged</u>(offset, reduce) their existing risk
      - fully hedged
      - partially hedged: not entirely offset
    - for buyer, it is **speculating** on future price: initially has no existing risk, add their risk enter into contract
      - way to eliminate price risk: <u>cash market transaction</u>, namely, simply sell buyers' shares
  - example: **forward contract**
    - pre-fixed price sell or buy the security in the specific future date
    - elements:
      - underlying
      - forward price
      - settlement date: the date of future transaction
      - contract size
      - value at contract initiation:0
    - the profit and loss from forward contract from buyer and seller:
      - compare forward price with market spot price
      - the gain of one party=loss amount of another
    - classification:
      - it can be `deliverable contract`: <u>payment and shares must be exchanged</u> at the settlement date
      - `cash settled contract`: only <u>gains & losses</u> from forward contract are exchanged at settlement
  - buyers and sellers:
    - Long: buyers are called to be long on position, has right to buy underlying under some condition
      - when <u>price of underlying increases</u>, forward buyer gains
    - Short: sellers are called to be short on position
- Potential Advantages of Derivatives:
  - investors gain exposure to risk at lower cost, giving *highly leveraged investment* in underlying effectively
  - <u>transaction cost</u> of derivative positions<< that of cash market trade
  - derivative position initialization has *less impact on underlying market prices*, than that of in <u>cash market</u>.
- Underlying Assets and Variables
  - 种类: asset, equities, stock or bond index, interest rate
  - in detail:
    - bond: risk is future bond prices uncertainty
    - index: risk is future index prices uncertainty
    - currency: exchange rate
    - interest rate: higher--><u>gains</u> for buyers' <u>interest rate forward</u>, also lower bond price, *losses for buyer of bond forward*
    - commodities: physical assets suffer <u>commodities price risk</u>
      - classification:
        - hard: gold and oil, mined or extracted
        - soft: typically grown, like cotton, coffee, pork, and cattle
    - credit derivatives: include `CDS(credit default swap)`
      - one party makes <u>periodical fixed payment</u> to another
      - payment made only if <u>underlying credit instrument suffers a loss</u>, owing to issuer's *default* of the product
      - swap: transfer risk of possible credit event default over to 3rd party.
    - other: created based on weather, cryptocurrencies, longevity(for life insurers)长寿, 长命
- other types of derivatives:
  - options:
    - put option: give buyer right to *sell* underlying for a specific price in the future
    - call option: give buyer right to buy .....
  - swaps: eg, interest rate swap, FX swap
    - one party makes periodic payments with a given *fixed interest rate*
    - another party makes periodic payments with <u>future market reference rate</u>(MRR), eg: LIBOR
    - resulting cash flow=fixed rate borrowing at fixed rate, using <u>proceeds to buy float-rate bond</u>.

## 2. Features of Derivative Markets, OTC Markets, and Exchange-traded Derivative Markets

- Exchange-Traded Derivatives
  - Definition: standardize and backed by *central physical exchanges* with trading rules
    - CPE: 为衍生品交易provides markets eg: National Securities Exchange(india), B3 Market(Brazil), CME group(the US)
    - central clearinghouse(CCH):
      - in opposite position to each side of trade(novation债券更新)
      - 保证payments promised under contract
      - it requires 双方deposits when trade is initiated, additional deposit when account declines in value, minimizing credit risk
  - Exchange Members: dealer and market maker
    - buy/sell in different price for earning trading profits from <u>bid/ask spread</u>而不是通过positions投机赚钱
  - advantages of standardize: (compared with *customized derivatives*)
    - exchange-traded derivatives more <u>liquid and transparent</u>
    - easy to <u>exit the position</u> by entering into an opposite position
    - reduce trading costs
    - 促进clearing and settlement of trades
      - clearing: execute the trade, record participants, handle required payments
      - settlement: exchange underlying assets, payments of the final amounts due at maturity
- Dealer Markets(OTC)
  - definition: *custom* instruments for meeting end user regarding *contract size needs*, *created and traded* by dealer <u>without central location</u>, the market is called `over-the-counter(OTC)` market
    - OTC: largely unregulated, less transparent, counterparty face credit risk
  - OTC derivative contract content: underlying, settlement date, whether contract is cash settled deliverable
  - a central counterparty(CCP): 承担credit risk of both side,类似于CCH的角色
    - downside: the counterparty risk are concentrated, 而不是分散在市场中
