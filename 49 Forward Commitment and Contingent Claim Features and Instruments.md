# Reading 49 Forward Commitment and Contingent Claim Features and Instruments

## 1. Forward and Futures

- Forward contracts: last Reading has mentioned
- Future contracts
  - similar to Forward Contract, but is <u>standardized and exchange-traded</u>(secondary market) 
  - backed by Central Clearinghouse(CCH), required daily cash settlement of gain/loss, minimizing counterparty credit risk
  - **margin**:
    - cash or 或者其他可抵押物, both buyer&seller must deposit
      - 抵押物provide protection for clearinghouse
    - no involved loan, no interest charges
    - **marking to market**: 每天结束, margin balance of future is adjusted for any gains/loss in position based on new <u>settlement price</u>.
      - settlement price calculation: <u>average prices of trades</u> at the end of the trading session
    - **Initial margin**:
      - 在trade开始之前，必须deposit在future account里的抵押物数目
      - per contract的数量is low, 约等于one day's max <u>expected price fluctuation</u> on total value of assets
    - **Maintenance Margin**: minimum amount of margin must be kept in account
      - if account balance < maintenance margin, the corresponding party should deposit additional amount until his account balance=*initial margin*，而不是maintenance one
      - if it is failed to maintain, the future position will be *closed out*.
      - it is set by the exchange.
  - price limits:
    - set by exchange
    - limit on how much each day's settlement price can change from previous day's.
    - *outside the price limit* execution is prohibited.
    - circuit breakers: when price reaches the price limits, trading is *suspended for a short period*.

## 2. Swaps and Options

- Swaps
  - Definition:
    - exchange a *series of payment* on *multiple settlement dates* over a period of time
    - on the payment date, two payments from counterparty are offset-->only *one net payment* is made
  - counterparty risk:
    - trade in dealer market-->high counterparty risk, unless 有CCH requires <u>margin deposit and make-to-market payments</u>
  - Basic Components:
    - fixed-for-floating interest swap in term of cash flow
      - fixed: swap rate
      - floating: market reference rate
        - related payment=notion principle amount * reference float rate@on the end of last payment date
    - maturity period
    - periodic payment frequency
    - notional principle
    - initialization value=0
      - during life of swaps, value of the swap for one party>0, for another party < 0
  - hedge: firm converts *floating-rate liability* into a *fixed-rate* one, **hedging** the interest rate risk.
  - Swaps and Forward:
    - swap is a series of forward contracts
    - each forward set on one swap settlement date
    - interest rate forward settle at <u>beginning</u> of each term==PV of end-term swap payments
- Credit Swaps
  - **protection buyers** *pay fixed amount* on each settlement date
    - hedging the default risk
    - pay the <u>yield premium</u> on reference bonds, the amount=expected loss in default event * probability of default
  - **protection seller** only pays when <u>has a credit event</u>, the amount is to offset the loss on reference securities
    - receive the default risk premium(credit spread)
    - take on the risk of default
- Options: call and put
  - element to consider: strike price(exercise price), time to expiration, put seller(the option writer)
    - one-way nature:
      - for put option, if <u>exercise price<= spot price</u>, the option buyer has no reason to exercise it, they will let option <u>expire</u>.
      - if exercise price > spot market price, exercise the option, the option buyers赚差价（现在市场价与先前定的价格）
  - value at expiration & profit from long/short position
    - option premium: the price of option. With a <u>non-zero initialization price</u>
    - value at expiration:
      - call option: $Max(0, S-K)$
        - S: price of underlying at expiration
        - K: strike price
        - when S< K-->call option value=0
      - put option: $Max(0,K-S)$
    - the *profit* of <u>option seller</u>: premium received-option payoff at expiration
      - if the payoff>premium received-->writer gets a loss
      - loss for call option seller: **unlimited** loss
        - because S is unlimited
        - the seller becomes lose money since from S>premium+K(the break-even point)
        - the profit is up to maximum when S< K, amount=premium
      - loss for put option seller: maximum=K
        - because S has minimum value 0
        - becomes loss when S< K-premium (the break-even point, the maximum loss is limited at this amount)
        - the maximum profit when S>K == premium
    - the profit of <u>option buyer</u>: value payoff-premium
      - loss of buyers: the amount they paid for option, if option is expired, namely maximum loss is premium
      - the call option start to gain: when S>premium+K, the profit potential is unlimited
      - the put option start to gain: when S< K-premium, the amount is limited: maximum up to K-premium
    - the *sum of profits* between buyers and sellers always==0, zero-sum game.
- forward commitment:
  - legally binding promise to do actions in future
  - content: forward contract, future contract, *most swap*
- contingent commitment:
  - claim/payoff depends *on a particular event*
  - content: options(underlying being above or below the exercise price), credit default swap(CDS)(trigger by credit default)
