## 1. Sampling Methods, Central Limit Theorem, Standard Error

- Sampling Error:

  - Definition: differences between a `sample statistic` and relative `population parameter`
    - Eg: sampling error of mean=sample mean-population mean= $x-\mu$
  - Sampling Distribution:
    - sample statistics is a r.v., having a probability distribution
    - the distribution of frequencies of a range of different outcomes that could possibly occur for a statistic of a population.有点难理解，简单来说就是统计量的概率分布，从 population 中选取不同个等量的 samples，每组 samples 得出一个统计值，整合起来就是统计量在不同组等量 samples 可能出现的统计值，遵从的一个概率分布。
- Several Sampling Methods:

  - Probability Sampling Methods: selecting a sample with `<u>`given probability `</u>` of each sample in population.
    - Simple Random Sampling: each item has equal probability of being selected.
    - Systematic Sampling: select every nth member from population
    - Stratified Random Sampling:
      - divide population into smaller groups or stratum, then _simple random sampling_ is applied in each stratum.
      - size of samples from each stratum $\sim$ size of stratum relative to the population（层数）
      - reduce sampling error
      - Application in Finance: bond indexing.
        - Reason: bonds are classified by certain risk factors: duration, maturity, coupon rate...
    - Cluster Sampling:
      - Definition:
        - divide population into several subsets(clusters), then use _simple random sample_ to select samples in individual group.
        - each cluster is a **representative** of population in terms of the item we sampling.
      - Types:
        - One-stage cluster sampling
        - Two-stage cluster sampling:
          - has **greater** sampling error than one-stage
      - Evaluation:
        - have **greater** sampling error than simple random sampling
        - less time and lower cost required
  - Non-probability Sampling Method: select samples using the _judgement of researchers_ and lower cost or easy access to some data items, with greater sampling error.
    - Convenience Sampling
      - definition: select sample data based on the ease of access, using data readily available
    - Judgement Sampling
      - Definition: select larger dataset based on experts experience and judgment.
      - PS: ensure the distribution of data of interest/feature is constant for population sampled.
- Central Limit Theorem(CLT)

  - reference: [https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter7/7_1_2_central_limit_theorem.php](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter7/7_1_2_central_limit_theorem.php)
  - Definition: for iid samples, the standardized sample mean→standard normal distribution, regardless the original population is normal or not, when n sample size is large enough($n>=30$)
  - Math Expression:
    - $\mu_{\bar{x}}=\mu$
    - $\sigma_{\bar{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt[2]{n}}$
    - $\bar{X}\sim N(\mu,\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt[2]{n}})$
    - $Z_n=\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt[2]{n}}}=\frac{X_1+X_2+..+X_n-n\mu}{\sqrt[2]{n}\sigma}$
    - cdf: $lim_{n→\infty}P(Z_n≤x)=\phi(x)$, where $\phi(x)$ is the standard normal cdf
- Standard Error of Sample Mean

  - Definition: `<u>`std `</u>` of the distribution of the _sample means_
  - With known population std $\sigma$, $\sigma_{\bar{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt[2]{n}}$
  - With unknown population std, we use sample std $s$ to inference population statistic. $s_{\bar{x}}=\frac{s}{\sqrt[2]{n}}$
    - less widely dispersed around expected value than a single observation with $\sigma$ of r.v.
  - relies heavily on sample size, when n increase, the _standard error of sample mean_ decreases, more close to true population level.
- Estimator Properties Description

  - Unbiased: - $Bias(\widetilde \theta)=E(\widetilde \theta)-\theta=0$
  - the `expected value of the estimator`=  `parameter` you are trying to estimate
  - Efficient
    - $MSE(\widetilde \theta)=Var(\widetilde \theta)+Bias(\widetilde \theta)^2$
    - has `<u>`smaller variance `</u>` of sampling distribution than all other unbiased estimators.
  - Consistent
    - $lim_{n→\infty}P(|\widetilde \theta-\theta|≥\epsilon)=0$, for all $\epsilon>0$.
    - the **accuracy** of parameter increases as the sample size increases.

## 2. Confidence Intervals, Resampling, and Sampling Biases

- Calculate CI for Population Mean with Given Variance a Normal Distribution

  - Point estimates: single values to estimate population parameters
    - eg: the estimator of population mean $\mu$: $\bar{x}=\frac{\sum{x}}{n}$
  - Confidence Interval(CI):
    - Definition: range of values population parameter is expected to lie in, given the probability $1-\alpha$
      - $\alpha$: level of significance
      - $1-\alpha$: degree of confidence
    - Calculation: `point estimate±(reliability factor * standard error)`
      - point estimate: value of a sample statistic of the population parameter
      - reliability factor: sampling distribution and probability lies in CI(通俗来说，就是标准统计量和$\alpha$的取值)
    - Eg: for known variance normal distribution, CI for population mean can be expressed as follows:
      - $\bar{x}±z_{\alpha/2}*\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt[2]{n}}$
        - $\alpha=10%$, 5% for each tail, $z_{\alpha/2}$=**1.645** for 90% CI
        - $\alpha=5%$, 2.5% for each tail, $z_{\alpha/2}$=**1.960** for 95% CI
        - $\alpha=1%$, 0.5% for each tail, $z_{\alpha/2}$=**2.575** for 99% CI
        - ...For more, z-score table should be used
  - Interpretation
    - Probabilistic interpretation: xx% of confidence intervals will include population parameter in the long run.
    - Practical interpretation: there are `<u>`xx% confidence `</u>` that the population parameter lies between $\bar{x}-z_{\alpha/2}*\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt[2]{n}}$ and $\bar{x}+z_{\alpha/2}*\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt[2]{n}}$ interval(比较常见)
- Calculate CI for Population Mean with Unknown Variance a Normal Distribution

  - Calculation: $\bar{x}±t_{\alpha/2}*\frac{s}{\sqrt[2]{n}}$
  - CI constructed by t-dist is *more wider* than those of z-dist.
  - the usage of t-table for getting the reliability factor values.
    - make sure we known the value of df(n-1) and $\alpha$
- Calculate CI for Population Mean with Unknown Variance for Large Sample from Any Distribution(CLT applied)

  - non-normal distribution, n≥30, known population variance→z-score
  - non-normal distribution, n≥30, unknown population variance→t-value
- Resampling(to estimate the `<u>`standard error `</u>` of mean)

  - 这个概念可能比较陌生，reference: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resampling_(statistics))
  - Jackknife
    - calculate multiple sample means, each with **1 observation removed** from the sample for reducing bias.
    - it can be used when numbers of observation is relatively small
    - Evaluation: low cost, computationally easy
  - Bootstrap
    - Evaluation: computationally demanding, get more accuracy
    - repeatedly draw samples(size=n) from full dataset, then directly calculate std and standard error of the sample mean
- Sampling Bias:

  - Data Snooping:数据窥探
    - when repeatedly use the same dataset to search a trading rule until it is discovered.有可能具有偶然性
    - Data snooping bias:
      - the statistical significance of the pattern is `<u>`overestimated `</u>`, because the results are found through data snooping
      - Signal:
        1. lack of economic theory support the result
        2. many tested variables are not reported, until the rule is found.
      - Solution: *change another dataset* to test the rule we got whether adopt or not.(use **out-of-sample data**)
  - Sample Selection Bias
    - some data systemically excluded from analysis, thanks to lack of availability.
    - The observed samples are _not random_. Hence, the conclusion draw from the this sample set **cannot** applied to **population**.
    - Survivorship Bias
      - most common type of sample selection bias
      - 有点类似于幸存者偏差, the observed data only include the items currently exist, without any pervious abandoned or ceased samples.
      - eg: mutual fund performance studies
      - Solution: use samples that *all started at the same time without any drop*
  - Look-ahead bias
    - test a relationship using sample data that wasn't available on the test date.
    - eg: price-to-book ratio calculation at the year end
    - Solution: the **estimation** of information lack variable is needed.
  - Time-period bias
    - the time period for gathering data is **too short or too long**
      - too short:有偶然性，phenomena specific,isolated occurrence
      - too long: the fundamental economic underlie background may changed 背景特征不同
        - Solution: data should divide into subgroups
