# Reading 51 Arbitrage, Replication, and the Cost of Carry in Pricing Derivatives

## 1. Arbitrage and Replication Used in Derivative Pricing

- Arbitrage:
  - Derivative valuation is based on `no-arbitrage condition`, law of one price
  - Definition: investor **buys** one asset/portfolio at one price, at the same time, **sell another** asset/portfolio <u>with the same identical future value</u>, at a higher price, realizing risk-free gain.【一买一卖】
    - 当套利发生时，会很快exploited
    - when arbitrage gain< transaction cost, the small prices difference will persist
    - have same cost currently of the two portfolios, to prevent arbitrage--> we can calculate $F_0(1)$ the forward price, which discounted value by yield==current cost
      - if $S_1$>$F_0(1)$--> profitable strategy is to <u>sell the forward and buy underlying asset</u>
        - the strategy return=($S_1$-$S_0$)/$S_0$ > Risk-free rate given
      - if $S_1$<$F_0(1)$--> profitable strategy is to <u>buy the forward and sell short underlying</u>(低买高卖,高抛低吸)
        - at t=0, the proceed from selling underlying: $S_0$-->invested in forward contract at risk-free rate, awarding $S_1$, deducting the cost of entrance cost==profit
    - the arbitrage actions will *move* the forward price *toward its no-arbitrage level*, prevent two assets with identical payoffs from selling at different prices
    - longer time t OR higher risk free rate-->higher forward price;
- Replication
  - Definition: create a portfolio with *cash market transactions* that has same payoffs as a derivative for all possible underlying future values
  - *derivative cash flow stream* can be recreated using long/short combined position of <u>underlying asset and borrowing/lending cash</u>
    - for a long forward:
      - be replicated by borrowing at $r$ to purchase underlying asset
      - the payoff on replication=S(T)-underlyingPrice(T)*(1+borrowingRate)^T=value of unit underlying-loan repayment
    - for the short forward:
      - be replicated by shorting underlying asset, using the proceed to invest at $r$
      - the settlement investor receives $S_0*(1+r)^t$, buying additional underlying at $S_1$
      - total payoff=$S_0*(1+r)^t-S_T$
  - ❗️allow us to calculate <u>asset no-arbitrage forward price</u>: given Time $T$
    - long replicate asset, short forward: $S_T-S_0(1+Rf)^T-[S_T-F_0(T)]=0$-->Non-arbitrage: $F_0(T)=S_0(1+Rf)^T$
    - short replicate asset, long forward: $S_0(1+Rf)^T-S_T+[S_T-F_0(T)]=0$
      - $F_0(T)$: enter long forward contract
      - $S_T-F_0(T)$: settle long forward contract
      - $S_0$: cash borrow price and spot price
      - $S_0(1+Rf)^T$: replay loan
      - $S_T-S_0(1+Rf)^T$: settle long forward contract
      - $S_0(1+Rf)^T-S_T$: choose of borrowing or purchasing

## 2. Difference between Spot and Expected Future Price of Underlying Asset & Cost of Carry 
  
- cost consideration: additional cost(commodities storage and insurance costs) should be included in non-arbitrage forward price calculation; Present value: $PV_0(cost)$
  - holding cost of the underlying asset exists, ↑ the no-arbitrage forward price
    - $F_0(T)=[S_0+PV_0(cost)](1+Rf)^T$
    - the holding costs should be paid at $t=0$
    - includes: opportunity costs of funds, Rf
- monetary benefits to holding asset: dividend payment(equity) or interest payment(debt); Present value: $PV_0(benefit)$
  - money benefits of the underlying asset exists, ↓ the no-arbitrage forward price
    - $F_0(T)=[S_0+PV_0(cost)-PV_0(benefit)](1+Rf)^T$
  - includes: cash flow yield, convenience yield
    - **Convenience yield**: hold commodities *with non-monetary or non-cash benefits*
      - situation to have convenience yield: 如果一个asset在市场很难sell short, 持有他may convey benefit；需求大，供应小，价格高
- Expressed as <u>continuously compounded rates of return</u>:
  - effective annual return: $e^r-1$, $r$: stated annual rate
  - $FV=Se^{rT}$, $PV=Se^{-rT}$
  - ❗️$F_0(T)=S_0e^{(r+c-b)T}$, with cost and benefit
- Net cost of carry(cost of carry): benefit of holding the asset-cost of holding the asset
  - if benefit>cost-->*forward price < spot price*
- the assumption of non-arbitrage forward price: $F_0(T)=S_0(1+Rf)^T$ is:
  - <u>no costs or benefit</u> when holding the asset
- Forward Contracts on Currencies
  - forward exchange rate(p/b)=$(1+r_{priceCurrency})/(1+r_{baseCurrency})$*spot exchange rate
  - it involves sales of one currency(short), buy another on a future date at a pre-defined price(long)
  - eg: long USD/EUR FX forward, involving <u>purchasing Euros & selling US dollars</u> at forward rate（long forward的话，买分子，卖分母货币）
    - Q1=amount of USD/exchange rate*(1+Rf_EUR)=at the end of one year investor' amount of EUR
    - Q2=amount of USD at the end of one year=amount of USD/(1+Rf_USD)以上两个价值在当时应该是相等的
    - Q1/Q2: no-arbitrage forward rate
      - if forward exchange rate > no-arbitrage one-->buy USD, sell EUR, making profit
      - if forward exchange rate < no-arbitrage one-->sell USD, buy EUR, making profit
    - Continuous compounding form: No-arbitrage condition FX forward rate=$S_0e^{(rp-rd)T}$
      - $Rp$:log(1+Rf_p)
      - $Rd$:log(1+Rf_b)
