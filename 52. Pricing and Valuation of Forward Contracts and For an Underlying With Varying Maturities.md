# Reading 52 Pricing and Valuation of Forward Contracts and For an Underlying With Varying Maturities

## 1. Price and Valuation of Forward Contract Determination, During the Life of Contract, and at Expiration

- initial value: priced at no-arbitrage value, $V_0(T)=S_0-F_0(T)(1+Rf)^{-T}=S_0-S_0=0$
- During the life: $V_t(T)=S_t-\frac{F_0(T)}{(1+Rf)^{T-t}}$
- At expiration: $V_T(T)=S_T-\frac{F_0(T)}{(1+Rf)^{T-T}}=S_T-F_0(T)$
  - gain if $S_T>F_0(T)$
  - loss if $S_T<F_0(T)$
- when $t<T$ forward value to the buyer:
  - $V_t(T)=[S_t+PV_t(cost)-PV_t(benefit)]-F_0(T)(1+Rf)^{-(T-t)}$

## 2. Forward Rate Determination

- Forward Rate Definition:
  - yields for future periods
    - eg:interest rate on 1-year loan to be made 2 year from today is a forward rate
  - notation: loan period length + how far in the future the money will be loaned(or borrowed)
    - 3y2y or $F_{3,2}$: 2-year loan, *starting point* is three years from now
    - 如果以月为单位: for money market rate, $3m6m$: 6-month rate, starting point is 3 months from now
    - for zero-coupon rate matured in n years: $Z_n$
- Implied forward rate:
  - eg: $(1+Z_2)^2=(1+Z_1)(1+F_{1,1})$--> $F_{1,1}$: implied no-arbitrage forward rate
    - first strategy: invest from $t0$ to the forward date, then rolling over the proceeds
    - second strategy: invest from $t_0$ until the end of forward period
    - two strategies's yields are the same(一个投资持续n年，另一个投资从同一时间开始持续m年+y(m+1)y(n-m)的forward，n>m，二者的收益率相同)
- Forward Rate Agreement
  - the example of *interest rate derivatives*(OTC)
  - it is primarily used by financial institutions to <u>manage volatility of interest sensitive asset&liability</u>
  - AFR相当于single-period swap
  - Multi-period swaps are used for managing *interest rate risk*.
  - fixed rate payer(long) pay the forward rate on notional principle amount at a future date
    - if realized MRR > implied forward rate-->fixed-rate payer gain
  - the floating-rate payer pay a future reference rate * notional principle amount
  - in practice，只有差价net amount is exchanged.
    - Cash Settlement=$(IFR_{A,B-A}-MRR_{B-A})×Notional Principle×Period$/(1+$IFR_{A,B-A}$/(n/12))
      - cash settlementPV=FV/discountRate
      - the FV is `net payment`
  - settlement payment at the beginning of period; While, <u>interest savings</u> be at the end of the period
