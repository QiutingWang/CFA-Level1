# Reading 53 Pricing and Valuation of Futures Contracts

## 1. Compare Price and Value of Forward and Future Contract

- Forward contract
  - price: constant, if there is no mark-to-market gain/losses <u>at the end of contract period</u>
    - mark-to-market Definition: there is a gain/loss position compared to <u>previous day's closing price</u>
  - value: fluctuate with underlying asset value changes
- Future contract:
  - price and value change if there is **daily** mark-to-market每天结束做到清零,每天开始reset future value==0
    - 几乎每天都变
  - price notation: $f_t(T)$, initialized value=0
    - the $f$ is for future, $F$ is for forward
    - Formula: $f_t(T)=[S_0-PV_0(benefit)+PV_0(cost)](1+r)^T$
      - the calculation is similar to forward's
      - continuous compounding expression formula:$f_0(T)=S_0e^{rT}$
  - the cumulative realized MTM gain/loss on future contract ≈ a comparable forward contract
- Interest rate future VS Forward Contract
  - interest rate future are *quoted on a price basis*.
  - Future price=100-(100×$MRR_{A,B-A}$), from time A to time B
    - MRR: market reference rate
    - *short* interest rate future gains from *arising* MRR
    - long interest rate future gains from falling MRR
  - After adjusted with daily MTM:
    - basis point value:
      - BPV=notional principle × period × 0.01%
      - intuition: one basis point change in MRR will change the future contract value by BPV

## 2. Explain Pricing Difference Between Future and Forward

- most difference: future contract MTM gain/loss is paid every day.
  - gains above initial margin-->can be withdrawn from future account
  - loss reduces margin deposit< maintenance level-->payment is required to account
  - the 2 prices difference depends on <u>interest rate volatility</u>
- When price of future & forward are same:
  - constant interest rate
  - future price and interest rate are uncorrelated
    - positive correlation:
      - for long position, settlement provides fund(excess margin part) when rate level is high;
      - require fund when rate level is low, deposited funds *opportunity cost* is low.
      - future contracts are more attractive than forward contract
    - negative correlation: future are *less attractive* than forward contract
- CCH: require derivative investors to post <u>MTM margin payments and margin</u> reporting.
- In reality, the difference between these two are not observed:
  - because short maturity of most forwards
  - availability of funds at near Rf rate.
- Convexity Bias:
  - if realized MRR(at settlement) equals to forward MRR increases one basis point:
    - the present value of long receives: $V1=\frac{BPV}{1+MRR_realized*period}$
  - if realized MRR(at settlement) equals to forward MRR decreases one basis point:
    - the present value of long payment: $V2=\frac{BPV}{1+MRR_realized*period}$
  - $V2>V1$, MRR数字越小，单位变化越大，斜率越高
  - hence, for longer horizon, difference between forward and future contracts will become larger.
