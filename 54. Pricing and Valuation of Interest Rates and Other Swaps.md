# Reading 54 Pricing and Valuation of Interest Rates and Other Swaps

## 1. Compare Swap and Forward Contract

- Component of payments: based on *notional principle*
  - 1 known payment
  - several unknown payment based on specific *forward rate agreement*(FRA)远期利率协议 
  - $MRR_n$: floating rate payment at the end of term n.
  - $F$: fixed amount owed at the end of each term
  - the net payment at period n=$|MRR_n-F|$
    - the net payment is settled at end of each period
- swap = a series of forward contract
  - forward contract rate==swap fixed rate
  - both FRA and swaps have symmetric payoff profile
  - **both have 0 value** at initialization
  - they both involved counterparty credit exposure
- the difference between two different contracts:
  - forward contract has a single settlement, at the **beginning** of interest period; While swaps has <u>periodical</u> settlements at the **end** of interest period.
  - while, swap needs to consist <u>forward with positive & negative values</u>有正有负，因为差价不一定都是同一方向的payment
    - 最后达到the sum of values==0 at initialization
  - **Par swap rate**: gives swap a <u>0 initialization value</u>, calculated by no-arbitrage pricing
  - forward每期的fixed rate大多都不一样，而swaps(as a series of forward)的每个term的fixed rate都一样
  - some investors are more favorable to <u>swap contracts</u>, with rate-sensitive asset&liabilities, with periodic cash flows
    - eg: fixed-coupon bonds, variable rate loans

## 2. Contrast Value and Price of Swap

- Par Swap Rate Calculation:
  - $\frac{MRR_1}{1+S_1}+\frac{MRR_2}{1+S_2}+\frac{MRR_3}{1+S_3}...+\frac{MRR_n}{1+S_n}=\frac{F}{1+S_1}+\frac{F}{1+S_2}+\frac{F}{1+S_3}...+\frac{F}{1+S_n}$
    - $S_n$:current spot rate at settlement date
    - $F$: fixed rate payment
    - $MRR_n$: implied/expected forward rates
