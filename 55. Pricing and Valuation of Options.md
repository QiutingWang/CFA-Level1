# Reading 55 Pricing and Valuation of Options

## 1. Exercise Value, Moneyness, Time Value of Option

- Moneyness: whether the option is <u>in the money or out of money</u>
  - in the money: generate a positive payoff
  - out of money: generate a loss payoff
  - at the money: current asset price=exercise price
- Notation:
  - $S$: underlying asset price
  - $K$: option strike/exercise price
  - Call options:
    - $S-K>0$: in the money
    - $S-K<0$: out of the money
    - $S=K$: at the money
  - Put options:
    - $S-K<0$: in the money
    - $S-K>0$: out of the money
- exercise price=max(0, amount that options is *in the money*)
  - at/out of the money, exercise price=0
- option premium=exercise value+time value
  - time value:
    - also called <u>speculative value of option</u>
    - when time goes to expiration, time value-->0

## 2. Arbitrage Usage, Replication Concept in Commitment Pricing

- Difference with forward contract:
  - option's initial value is positive
  - gain&loss:
    - forward contract both buyer and seller have unlimited loss/gain; 
    - Option: one-sided, potential loss for buyer, potential gain for writer, the amount is limited to <u>premium paid</u>.
  - Hence, the *no-arbitrage pricing method for contingent is different* from forward commitment.
- Notations: For European options
  - $T-t$: time to expiration
  - $c_t$: price of European call at any time t prior to expiration
  - $p_t$: price of European put at time t prior to expiration
- Upper bound for call option: $c_t<=S_t$
- Upper bound for put option: PV of exercise price discounted on Rf
  - $p_t<=\frac{K}{(1+R_f)^{T-t}}$
- Lower bound for call option:
  - $c_t>=Max[0,S_t-\frac{K}{(1+Rf)^{(T-t)}}]$
    - 由$c_0+\frac{k}{(1+Rf)^T}-S_0>=0$推导
- Lower bound for put option:
  - $p_t>=Max[0,\frac{k}{(1+Rf)^{T-t}}-S_t]$

## 3. Factors Affect Option Values

- Price of underlying assets:(S)
  - for call options, positive related（K< S才有值-->K-S<0）
  - for put options, negative related(S< K才有值-->K-S>0)
    - increase in underlying prices, value of put option↓
- Exercise price(K)
  - higher, call option's value↓  与call负相关
  - ↑, put option's value↑
- Interest risk free rate(Rf):原因看lower bound of call/put option
  - ↑, call option's value↑ 与call正相关
  - ↑, put option's value↓
- underlying price volatility:↑, both call and put options prices increase 正相关
- Time to expiration:与call正相关 ($T-t$)
  - longer time to expiration, increase underlying price volatility, call option price increase
  - ↑, put option value↓
  - Formula:Rf在PV项的分母位置上
    - call option exercise value: Max(0,($S_t-PV(K)$))
    - put option exercise value: Max(0,($PV(K)-S_t$))
- Cost and benefits of holding the asset
  - Benefit for holding: convenience yield, dividend, interest payment
    - increase, call option value↓, put option value↑ 与call负相关
      - if pay the benefit, the underlying asset value(S) decrease
  - Cost for holding: storage
    - increase, call option value↑, put option value↓与call正相关
      - Formula: $S_0-PV(Benefit)+PV(Cost)$
