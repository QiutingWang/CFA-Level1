# Reading 56 Option Replication Using Put-Call Parity

## 1. For European Options

- Definition of Put-Call Parity: two portfolio combination 4种标的
  - fiduciary call
    - Definition: combination a call with exercise price K and pure-discount *paying K at maturity*(the face value of the bond)
      - pure-discount bond: make only one payment of principal and interest,就是Zero-coupon bond
    - cost of the strategy: $c_0+\frac{K}{(1+Rf)^T}$
    - payoff:
      - out of the money: 0+K=K
      - in the money: S-K+K=S [call的公式中都是S在前，K在后;put的计算公式都是K在减号前] 
  - protective put
    - Definition: a stock share(underlying asset) + put option on the stock, market value of the stock share is S
    - cost of the strategy: $p_0+S_0$
    - payoff:
      - out of the money: 0+S=S
      - in the money: K-S+S=K
  - according to Put-Call Parity, fiduciary call=protection put, forming a *no-arbitrage* condition
    - 当处在K-S>0 或 K-S<0同一状态下
      - put的in the money相当于call的out of the money
    - Formula Expression: 🌟$c+\frac{K}{(1+Rf)^T}=S+p$
      - $c=S+p-\frac{K}{(1+Rf)^T}$...以此类推，知一得三
        - the meaning of the signs:
          - -: short position
          - +: long position
    - the condition is hold when:
      - the option is **European**, but not American
      - put and call must have the <u>same exercise price</u>
  
## 2. Put-Call Forward Parity Contracts

- use <u>forward contract</u> instead of *underlying asset*(stock)
- Notations:
  - forward contract price: $F_t(T)$
  - forward contract initial value==0
- the parity relationship in present value: $\frac{F_0(T)}{(1+Rf)^T}+p_0=c_0+\frac{K}{(1+Rf)^T}$
  - variation: at time 0, $p_0-c_0=\frac{K-F_0(T)}{(1+Rf)^T}$
- Application the Option Theory in Corporate Finance:
  - conversion:
    - treat equity holder's claim要求（receipt） as `call option`
    - treat bond holder's claim as `put option`
  - For Equity:
    - assume:
      - periodical payment of bond is $D$
      - firm's value is $V_t$
    - Conditions:
      - if $V_t>D$, the equity holders' receipt=$V_t-D$
      - if $V_t<D$, the firm is insolvent破产,equity holders receive 0
      - hence, the equity payoff: $Max(0,V_t-D)$
  - For Bonds:
    - if $V_t>D$, the bond holders' receipt= $D$
    - if $V_t<D$, the firm is insolvent, bond holders receive $V_t$
    - hence, bond payoff: $Max(D,V_t)$
