# Reading 57 Valuing a Derivative Using a One-Period Binomial Model

## 1. Value Derivatives Using One-Period Binomial Model

- Model Elements We Need:
  - underlying value at the beginning period $S_0$
  - option exercise price $K$
  - risk free rate
  - returns that result from value *up-move and down-move* over one period
    - $S_1^u$(up),$S_1^d$(down)
    - the return(factor) from move up:$R^u=S_1^u/S_0$
    - the return(factor) from move down: $R^d=S_1^d/S_0$
- option value may be <u>in the money or out of the money</u> after moving
  - call option:
    - the value at expiration after moving: $c_1^u=Max(0,S_1^u-K)$ OR $c_1^d=Max(0,S_1^d-K)$
    - calculation of initial value $c_0$:
      - assume we *have a portfolio* with call option and <u>shares of stock($h$)</u>
        - we short the call option, long the stock
      - initial value of portfolio: $V_0=hS_0-c_0$
      - ðŸŒŸ$V_1^u=V_1^d$
        - $hS_1^u-c_1^u=hS_1^d-c_1^d$
          - we can get: $h=\frac{c_1^u-c_1^d}{S_1^u-S_1^d}$
          - $h$: *number of underlying shares* we would buy for each call option we write->**hedge ratio**
    - $V_1^u$ and $V_1^d$: must == $V_0$ compounded at $Rf$ for 1 period
      - We can get $V_0=\frac{V_1^{u(d)}}{(1+Rf)^1}$
      - Then we get $c_0=hS_0-V_0$

## 2. Value Derivatives Using Risk Neutrality Probabilities

- The elements we need:
  - $R^u$: up-move factor, size of an move-up
  - $R^d$: down-move factor
    - $R^d=\frac{1}{R^u}$
  - $\pi _U$: up-move risk-neutral probability
    - $\pi_U=\frac{1+Rf-R^d}{R^u-R^d}$
  - $\pi _D$: down-move risk-neutral probability
    - $\pi _D=1-\pi _U$
    - $\pi_D=\frac{U-1-Rf}{R^u-R^d}$
- Notes: the two risk-neutral probabilities != actual probabilities
  - calculate option payoffs for up-move and down-move prices
  - calculate the <u>expected option payoff</u>($c_1^U$ and $c_1^D$, if we take 1-year call option on stock as example) *average weighed* by risk-neutral probabilities including both up-and down-moves
    - the only difference between put and call options is the payoff calculation: put: $Max(0, K-S)$
  - calculate the PV of expected payoff discounted on Rf
    - $c_0=\frac{c_1}{(1+Rf)^1}$
