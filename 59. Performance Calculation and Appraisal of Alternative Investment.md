# Reading 59 Performance Calculation and Appraisal of Alternative Investment

## 1. Performance Appraisal Issues

- Risk Raise Reasons:
  - lack of transparency
  - illiquidity, restrictions on redemptions
  - position and strategies complexity
  - use of derivatives
  - securities mark-to-market
  - use of leverage
  - various expertise strategies and area
  - cash drag from significant drawdown periods
  - during economic crisis, the return correlations increases up to 1, that is, the diversification benefit不见了
- Evaluation Matrix:
  - Sharpe Ratio:excess return per unit risk
    - sharpe ratio=(Rp-Rf)/std of return
    - issue: std cannot be a perfect measurement for returns with *non-normal distribution*
      - indicator: skewness, kurtosis
  - Sortino Ratio:
    - drawback of above two: don't take *diversification and correlation* benefits into consideration
    - but it is prefer to sharpe ratio, Sortino Ratio use the downside std of return.
    - 仅对低于用户指定目标或要求的收益率的回报进行惩罚
  - Treynor Ratio: also call reward-to-volatility ratio
    - Treynor Ratio=(Rp-Rf)/$\beta_p$
      - lower $\beta$, higher Treynor Ratio
  - Calmar Ratio回撤比率
    - Calmar Ratio=Average Annual Rate of Return/Maximum DrawDown
    - the larger, the better
- Performance Appraisal for <u>Private Capital and Real Estate</u>
  - 观察inflow and outflow, and cash returned
  - measurement:
    - **Multiple of Invested Capital**(or **Money Multiple**, MoM)
      - MoM=(total capital returned + value of remaining asset)/total capital paid
      - without considering time value of money,有点naive
    - IRR
      - 弥补了MoM的缺陷
      - given the variability of cash flows over life, timing and magnitude of after-tax cash flows, IRR is the best measurement.
  - <u>Fee drag</u> in return calculation based on committed capital
    - 并不是一次性结清，而是分阶段交错的
    - 在investment的early stage, return are relative low; while, in the late stage of period, return gets higher.

## 2. Calculate Alternative Investment Returns Before and After Fees

- Before-Fee return就像平常计算return on investment一样
- Negotiated Fee Structure
  - 对象: investors making larger commitments可以去谈判得到lower fees
    - trade-off between <u>liquidity provisions and fees</u>
  - 可谈判的elements:
    - lower fees
    - better liquidity: shorter lockup, shorter notice period
    - hurdle rate
    - soft or hard hurdle
    - catch-up provisions
  - Annual investor fees can be <u>either-or fees</u>-->the maximum(management fee, incentive fee)
    - 计算下一年的management fee的时候，base要减掉上一年的management fee和incentive fee
  - **Founder Shares**: Some early investors(LP) may receive a <u>lower fees and higher liquidity</u> as an incentive.
