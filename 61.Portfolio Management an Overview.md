## 1. Portfolio Management Process

- Portfolio Approach to Investing

  - Diversification allows to **reduce portfolio risk** without reducing the portfolio expected return.
  - use std of returns as the measure of investment risk, unless the returns of assets are **perfected positively correlated**, risk is reduced by reduced by diversifying across assets.
  - Modern Portfolio Theory(MPT): equilibrium expected returns of securities and portfolios are **a linear function** of market risk, which cannot be reduced by diversification.（可能是$\beta$)
  - **Diversification Ratio**=risk of an `<u>`equally weighted portfolio `</u>` of n securities/risk of `<u>`a single security `</u>` selected at random from n securities.(measured by standard deviation of returns)
    - range: $(0,1]$. The lower, the greater risk-reduction benefit from diversification.
    - computer optimization can get the **portfolio weights** that will get lowest portfolio risk.
  - Portfolio diversification works well `<u>`when the financial market operated normally `</u>`. When during financial crisis, correlations tend to increase, the diversification effects get eased.
- Portfolio Management Process Steps

  1. Planning
     - **Investment Policy Statement(IPS)**:
       - Content: investor's risk tolerance, return objectives, time periods, tax exposure, liquidity needs, income needs, other `<u>`investors' preferences and constrains `</u>`.
       - Updates at least every few years, and when investors' situation changes significantly.
  2. Execution
     - Analysis return and risk traits of various asset classes(cash, fixed income securities, hedge funds, private equity, real estate, commodity...) to determine how funds will be **allocated**. security analysis is needed.r
       - Top-down analysis: consider current `<u>`economic conditions `</u>` and forecast related variables to `<u>`identify most attractive asset classes `</u>`.
     - Bottom-up analysis: identify the `<u>`most attractive securities `</u>` within asset class.
  3. Feedback
     - PM should **monitor the important changes**(investor needs and constrains, risk and return pattern of asset class, actual weights of assets in portfolio)
     - `<u>`Re-balance `</u>` the portfolio periodically in response.
       - **Adjust** allocations to desired percentages
       - measure portfolio performance and **evaluate** it in terms of benchmark portfolio.
