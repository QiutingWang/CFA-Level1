# Reading62: Portfolio Risk and Return Part1

## 1. Returns Measures

- Major Return Measures

  - Holding Period Return(HPR)
    - Formula: $HPR=end \space of \space period \space value/beginning \space of \space period \space value -1=\frac{P_t+Div_t}{P_0}-1=\frac{P_t-P_0+Div_t}{P_0}$
    - Definition: % increase in the value of investment in a specific time period
  - Average Returns
    - Arithmetic mean return=$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nR_i}{n}$
    - Geometric mean return=$\sqrt[n]{\prod_{i=1}^n(1+R_i)}-1=\sqrt[n]{1+HPR}-1$
  - Gross Return:
    - Definition: total return *before **deduct*** **the management and administration fees** of investment account
    - commissions on traders and other costs related to returns generation should be deducted.
  - Net Return: return after these fees deducted
  - Pre-tax Nominal Return
  - After-tax Return: after the tax liability deducted
  - Real Return:
    - nominal return adjusted for inflation
    - measures the increase in an investor's purchasing power
  - Leveraged Return:
    - Definition: the return on assets `<u>`partially using borrowed money`</u>`
    - Calculation: gain or loss/cash investment *100%
    - common in `<u>`real state`</u>` industry: investors often pay a part of a property cost in cash and borrow the rest.
- Money-Weighted Return(MWR)

  - Process
    - take all cash inflows and outflows at the corresponding time
    - $PV_{inflows}=PV_{outflows}$
    - solve $IRR$ by trial and error, by financial calculator, or by spreadsheet
    - Calculate money weighted return using solved $IRR$.
  - Financial Calculator Process Example:

| Key Buttons                          |        Explanation        |
| :----------------------------------- | :-----------------------: |
| `[CF][2ND][CLR WORK]`              | clean cash flow registers |
| `[CashFlowPV][+/-][ENTER]`         |     initial cash flow     |
| `[↓][CashFlowPV][+/-][ENTER]`     |   period one cash flow   |
| `[↓][↓][CashFlowPV][+/-][ENTER]` |   period two cash flow   |
| `[IRR][CPT]`                       |       calculate IRR       |

- Time-Weighted Rate of Return(TWR)

  - measure compound growth, a **rate** at which $1 compounds over a specific period.
  - Process of `<u>`annual`</u>` time-weighted return:不用换算成PV

    1. value the portfolio's additions or withdrawals at the corresponding time.(list each of them)
    2. compute **HPR** at each sub-period
    3. calculate entire total return: $\prod_{i-1}^t(1+HPR_t)-1$
       - $t$: numbers of sub-period

    - if total investment period>one year, take the `<u>`geometric average`</u>` for previous return result, getting the annual TWR.
  - Evaluation: preferred method thanks to `<u>`not affected by timing`</u>` of cash inflows and outflows
- Comparison between MWR and TWR

  - for relatively poor portfolio performance, MWR < TWR.
  - for favorable performance time, MWR > TWR.
  - The use of `TWR` provides a better measure of manager's ability to select investment over time period.
- Major Asset Classes Characteristics to Form Portfolios

  - **small-cap stocks** gain highest average returns and greatest risks over period.小市值策略
  - assets with `<u>`higher return`</u>`, also with `<u>`higher std of returns`</u>`.
  - T-bills have the least risk.
  - real return is much more stable than nominal return.
  - Liquidity is a major concern for `<u>`emerging markets`</u>` and for `<u>`infrequently traded securities`</u>`.
  - Also needs to care about `<u>`kurtosis and skewness`</u>`, which some **distributions are not normal**.

## 2. Risk Aversion

- Risk Aversion

  - Definition: investors dislike risk, preferring less risks, with small $\sigma$.
  - Financial models assume all investors are risk averse.
- Risk Seeking(risk-loving)

  - given equal expected return, investors who `<u>`prefer more risks`</u>` to less.
- Risk Neutral: no preference regarding risk. Hence, there is indifference between two given equal expected returns.
- Optimal Portfolio Selection with Utility and Capital Allocation Graph

  - utility function: the degree of risk aversion, trade-off between risk and return
  - indifference curve: plot combination of **return and risk** level where investors feel indifferent
    - slope upward, because risk reverser seeks for smaller risk for one unit of return change.
  - Variable of axis: standard deviation of return(horizontal), and return(vertical)
  - Two-Fund Separation Theorem: Portfolio `<u>`combination between risk-free asset(B) and risky asset(A)`</u>`
    - If there are only 2 assets: $\sigma_{portfolio}=\sqrt[2]{W_A^2*\sigma_A^2}=W_A\sigma_A$
      - Rf-Asset with **0 std and 0 corr** with risky asset.
    - Capital allocation line直线: the line presents the **possible allocation weights** of rf-assets and optimal risky assets.
      - Variable in axis: std of return and return
      - $b_0$(截距): the value of $R_f$
      - （经过the optimal risky portfolio）
      - 找到资产配置线和utility function的交点，有时会出现多个交点，直线距离靠近原点的为最优选择。（比较交点的return/risk比）
      - **less risk-averse investors** choose to allocate `<u>`more`</u>` on `<u>`risky asset portfolio`</u>`, less on rf-asset optimally.

## 3. Portfolio Standard Deviation

- Asset Returns Mean, Variance, Correlation with Historical Data

  - Variance(Variability)
    - $\sigma^2=\frac{\sum_{t=1}^T(R_t-\mu)^2}{T}$
    - $s^2=\frac{\sum_{t=1}^T(R_t-\bar{R})^2}{T-1}$
  - Covariance
    - $Cov_{1,2}=\frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n}[(R_{t,1}-\bar{R_1})(R_{t,2}-\bar{R_2})]}{n-1}$
      - $n$: number of periods
    - the extent to 2 variables move together over time.关注sign
    - unit of cov=return unit squared
  - Correlation Coefficient:
    - $\rho_{1,2}=\frac{Cov_{1,2}}{\sigma_1\sigma_2}$
    - standardize the co-movement of covariance
    - range:$[-1,1]$
    - whether the directions are the same or opposite between deviation from the expected return
    - unit of corr=return unit
- Portfolio Standard Deviation Calculation

  - Two Risky Assets
    - $\sigma_{p}^2=w_1^2\sigma_1^2+w_2^2\sigma_2^2+2w_1w_2Cov_{1,2}$, $w_2=1-w_1$
    - $\sigma_{p}^2=w_1^2\sigma_1^2+w_2^2\sigma_2^2+2w_1w_2\rho_{1,2}\sigma_1\sigma_2$, with the effect of correlation

## 4. Efficient Frontier

- Portfolio Risk without Perfectly Positive Correlated

  - 2 assets portfolio with positively perfect correlation:
    - $\sigma_{p}^2=w_1^2\sigma_1^2+w_2^2\sigma_2^2+2w_1w_2\sigma_1\sigma_2*1=w_1\sigma_1+w_2\sigma_2$, no any diversification risk reduction effects.
  - smaller correlation value, more diversification risk reduction effect.
- Global Minimum-Variance Portfolio

  - Minimum-variance portfolios: lowest standard deviation of portfolio, together making up **minimum-variance frontier**.
  - Efficient Frontier: the portfolios with **greatest return** at each level of risk.
  - 上半边缘的minimum-variance frontier与efficient frontier重合.这部分为investors的选择部分，最大化收益.
  - Global Minimum-Variance Portfolio: portfolio with `<u>`least risks`</u>` located on efficient frontier.一般位于重合部分的最尾端的点
