### Risk and Return Objectives Development(make sure they are compatible)

- Risk Objectives
  - Absolute risk objective
    - Form:
      - strict limits on portfolios result, offering guaranteed returns
      - in terms of **percentage** of portfolio results
  - Relative risk objective
    - relate to a specific benchmark strictly or in terms of probability
- Return Objectives
  - relative to a benchmark portfolio return
    - For bank, the specific benchmark: **deposit rate**(bank cost of funds)
    - However, <u>peer portfolio benchmarks</u> suffer from not being investable portfolios. No way to match this investment return before portfolio construction.

### Financial Risk Tolerance

- ability to bear risk
  - depend on financial circumstances客观状况: long investment period, high asset-liability, secure job
- willingness to bear risk
  - depend on primarily investor's <u>attitudes and beliefs</u>主观思想 about investments

### Investment Constraints(Risk-Return-TTLLU)

- Time Horizon
  - Rule: *longer* investment horizon, investors can bear *more risk* and accept *less liquidity*.
  - For investors with short investment period, <u>government securities and bank deposits</u> are appropriate, for their low risk and high liquidity.
- Tax Situation
  - different types of <u>investment accounts</u> subject to different tax rate, in addition to <u>individual overall tax rate</u>.
    - For fully taxable accounts,invests subject to higher tax rates prefer to tax-free bonds.
    - **retirement accounts**, might be *tax exempt* or tax *deferred*. Investors with these accounts may invest securities which generate fully taxed income.

  - <u>Corporate officers and directors</u> have legal restrictions to trade their firms' securities
- Liquidity:流动性
  - Definition: turn investment into <u>spendable cash</u> in a short period without significant price as costs
  - illiquid investments in hedge funds and private equity are not traded and have restrictions 来赎回, which are not fit for investors seeking for access.
- Unique Circumstance
  - have specific preference(diversification is needed) and restrictions
    - Eg1: founder of company may not invest in competitors' company
    - Eg2: Ethical preference, Religious preference
    - Eg3: restrictions on investments in companies or countries is an <u>abuse of human right</u>.
  - responsible investing: include non-financial considerations
  
### Specification of Asset Classes with Asset Allocation Issues

- strategic asset allocation with specific percentages among asset classes in the portfolio.
- <u>the correlation of returns</u> within the same asset class
  - *high*. The investment performance is similar
  - *low*, the risk reduction diversification effectiveness is good.
- Recently, <u>alternative investments</u> gain more popularity, including HF, PE funds, commodity funds, artwork, intellectual property rights.
- Once the universal asset classes is defined, the return, risk, correlation of returns can be generated.
  
### Portfolio Construction Principle

- <u>efficient frontier</u> can be constructed by programming.
- combine the risk&return objectives and actual performances on EF.
- Tactical Asset Allocation战术的: PM varies allocation weights to take advantage of <u>perceiving short-term opportunities</u>
- Security Selection: deviations from *index weights* on individual securities within an asset class.以指数的weights作为参考调比重
  - for <u>alternative investments</u> products are **not** available. Their selection depends on <u>nature of asset class</u>.
- Risk budgeting: set an overall risk limit for portfolio. The parts from systematic risk, from tactical asset allocation, and from security selection.
- Active Investment Considerations(2):
    1. many active PM use the **same benchmark** for **same asset class** or heavy overlap, leading to no net active management risk
    2. all managers refer to the same index, trading will be excessive overall, leading to higher negative tax consequences.
    - Core-satellite approach:
      - invest <u>majority</u> of the portfolio in **passive** managed indexes, and invest <u>smaller</u> of the portfolio in **active** managed indexes.
- The success depends on PM ability and short-term opportunities.
