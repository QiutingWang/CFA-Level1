# Reading66 Introduction to Risk Management

## 1. Introduction to Risk Management

- Definition

  1. identify the risk tolerance
  2. measure the risk that company faces
  3. modify and monitor the risks

  - return above risk-free rate is earned by taking on risk
  - return cannot under control, while specific or overall level risk can be under control
  - Goal: maximum the expected return given a certain level of risk
- Risk Management Framework Features: adjusts its risk to a predetermined level.
  - *process and policies* for <u>risk governance</u>
  - determine the *risk tolerance*(top)-->reflect its competitive positions
  - measure the *existing risks*
  - achieve *optimal* bundle of risk
  - monitor *risk exposure*
  - communication
  - perform strategic risk analysis(end)
- Risk Governance and Elements(top-down)
  - setting **overall** organization risk exposure
  - factor:
    - negatives outside events, regulatory environment, financial strength, and ability to withstand losses.
  - risk from inside organization and from outside
- Risk Budget
  - Single metric: portfolio beta, value at risk, portfolio duration, returns variances
  - constructed by categories
  - force the company to do risk-tradeoff, choosing to invest where the return per unit of risk is the highest.
  - identify specific risk factors that comprise the overall risk of the portfolio or organization
- Financial and non-financial risk
  - Financial risk
    - credit risk: uncertainty about whether *counterparty* to a transaction will `<u>`fulfill its contractual obligations `</u>`.
    - liquidity risk: loss of selling assets when *market price < fair value*
      - happens: a widening bid–ask spread.买卖价差(ask price-bid price)，资产价格市场上相对贬值
      - also called: transaction cost risk
    - market risk: uncertainty of **market prices** of assets/stocks/commodity and interest rates.
  - Non-financial risk(from operations of organization and sources `<u>`external `</u>` to the organization)
    - operational risk:human error,faulty origination process, business interruptions.
      - eg: cyber计算机技术 risk: disruptions of organization's information technology
    - solvency risk偿付能力: unable to continue to operate owing to lack of money
    - regulatory risk: regulation environment change, cost increasing and set up additional restrictions
    - governmental/political risk
    - legal risk
    - model risk: asset valuation model's incorrect.
    - tail risk: uncertainty about the probability of **extreme**/negative outcomes
      - unlikely but substantial losses, typically results from using inappropriate modeling assumptions
    - accounting risk: related to accounting policies and estimates are incorrect
    - Settlement risk: related to `default risk` but deals with *the timing of payments* rather than the risk of default.
      - a kind of counterparty risk
  - Individuals
    - mortality risk: 提前provide his family financial needs
      - reduced by life insurance
    - longevity risk: risk of living longer that assets will run out, financial planning is important
      - reduced by purchasing a lifetime annuity
- Measuring and modifying risk exposure
  - Measure risk of specific asset
    - Standard deviation
      - measure of the volatility of `<u>`asset prices `</u>` and `<u>`interest rates `</u>`
      - **not** fit for measuring of risk for `<u>`non-normal probability `</u>`
      - more fit for `<u>`stand-alone asset `</u>`, not really fit for portfolios.
    - Beta
      - measure the market risk of **equity securities** and **portfolios**, considering the diversification risk reduction effects
    - Duration
      - measure of `<u>`price sensitivity `</u>` of **debt** security to **interests rates** changes
  - Derivation risks($Greeks$)
    - Delta: sensitivity of *derivatives value* to the *price* of underlying asset.($\delta$)
    - Gamma: sensitivity of *Delta* to changes in *price* of underlying asset($\gamma$)
    - Vega: sensitivity of *derivatives values* to the *volatility of the price* of underlying asset($\varOmega$)
    - Rho: sensitivity of *derivatives values* to changes in *risk-free rate*.($\rho$)
  - Measurement of Tail risk
    - VaR
      - definition: `<u>`minimum loss `</u>` over period will occur with a specific probability
      - do not provide the maximum loss for a period
      - application: bank risk measurement in establishing *minimum capital requirement*
      - method: historical method, Variance-Correlation method, Monte Carlo Simulation
    - CVaR(Conditional Value at Risk)
      - Definition: the `<u>`expected value at losses `</u>`,given the losses >> a minimum amount.
      - expected shortfall
  - Subjective and Market-Based Estimates of Risks
    - Stress Testing: examine the effects of *extreme changes* in a key variable.
    - Scenario Analysis: similar to *what-if analysis* of expected losses and combined with many inputs changes
    - Subjective Estimate: used for infrequent events, bankruptcy, unexpected changes in tax laws or regulatory environment.
      - Operational cost: difficult to quantify, using `<u>`large sample of firms `</u>` to determine overall probability of significant losses
    - Market-Based Estimates: use **market prices** of insurance, derivatives, or other securities to hedge the risk.
  - Modify Risk Exposures
    - Goal: not to eliminate all risks, but to `<u>`find optimal `</u>` mix of risks, through **accept, avoid, transfer, shift** a risk.
      - take on more of some risks, decreasing others, and eliminating some together.
    - Avoid risk: not engaging in the activity which will induce risks
    - Bear the risk:
      - `<u>`diversification `</u>` : a way to beat the risk efficiently.
        - eg: <u>a bank</u> that establishes a loan loss reserve fund.拓展自身业务
      - also called **self-insurance**: *inaction*不采取行动 or eg: firms will establish a *reserve account*储备账户 to cover loss
    - Risk Transfer:
      - another party takes the risk
      - eg:
        - **insurance**: The insurance company without `<u>`high correlated `</u>` risks or a `<u>`single very large risk `</u>` is best.
          - Solution: this insurance company should shift the risk by `<u>`buying reinsurance `</u>` from another company.
        - **Surety Bond**: if the third party fails to perform under terms of agreement with the organization, the insurance company should make a payment.
        - **Fidelity bonds**: insurance company pays for losses from `<u>`employee theft or misconduct `</u>`.
    - Risk Shifting:
      - Definition: change the distribution of possible outcomes and is accomplished primarily with `<u>`derivative contracts `</u>`.
      - eg: a bond portfolio hedged with an interest rate option.
