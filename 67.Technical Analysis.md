# Reading67 Technical Analysis

## 1. Principle and Assumptions

- Definition:
  - collective market sentiment study(price and volume), expressed by buying and selling of assets.
  - prices determined by `<u>`supply and demand `</u>` interaction
  - `<u>`participants who actually trade `</u>` affect prices
  - `<u>`better-informed `</u>` participants trend to trade in a greater volume.
- Three Principle:
  1. market prices reflect all known **information**
  2. market prices express **trend** and countertrends 逆倾向 to persist
  3. patterns and cycles **repeat** themselves in predictable ways.历史重现

## 2. Links between Technical Analysis and Behavioral Finance

- TA reflects both _rational and irrational_ investor behavior.
- **_Efficient markets hypothesis_ doesn't hold**(理性、有效), technicians believe people are `<u>`erratic and emotional `</u>`.
- TA believes investors respond in **similar** ways to similar situations over time, hence the trading patterns and volumes will repeat itself.
- Recognize the certain patterns will `<u>`provide information `</u>` about _forecasting future_.
- **price and volumes** reflect all reasons why investors buy or sell, regardless whether it reflects security's `<u>`intrinsic value `</u>`
- reflect market microstructure(order types, tick size 最小报价单位...)

## 3. Technical Analysis VS Fundamental Analysis

- Intrinsic Value Determinate Factor
  - TA: firm's share price and trading volume data, more objective
  - FA: company's financial statements, such as financial position, which are sometimes subjective judgement.
- Approaches
  - TA: practical
  - FA: Theoretical
- Application
  - TA:
    - can apply to prices of assets which **not produce future cash flows**, such as commodities.
    - can be used even if the financial statements are **fraud**.
    - However, Sometimes TA cannot provide accurate information about demand and supply.
      - It cannot be used for `<u>`illiquid markets `</u>` and markets which are `<u>`outside manipulation `</u>`
      - Eg: **short covering** can make `<u>`bankrupt companies `</u>` gain _positive_ technical patterns, even through the stock price will go 0.
        - Short Covering: buying back borrowed securities to close out an open short position at a profit/loss.

## 4. Types of Technical Analysis Charts

- Line Chart
  - `<u>`closing prices `</u>` for each period as a continuous line
- Bar Chart
  - include `<u>`high price, low price, opening price, closing price `</u>` for each trading period.
  - display as a **vertical** line
  - closing price: `<u>`right `</u>` side of the line
  - opening price: `<u>`left `</u>` side of the line
- Candlestick Chart
  - include `<u>`high price, low price, opening price, closing price `</u>` for each trading period.
  - display as a **bounded box** by _opening_ and _closing_ prices
  - filled 黑: closing price < opening price
  - clear 白: closing price > opening price
- Volume Chart
  - with period number of units of the security traded
  - vertical lines
  - used to confirm trend by configuring the relationship between prices and volume trends
    - price and volume sold move in **same** position
    - price and volume sold move in **opposite** position
- Relative Strength Analysis
  - Ratio: asset closing price/benchmark values(eg: stock index or comparable asset)
  - increasing trend(positive relative strength): asset **outperforms** the benchmark
  - decreasing trend(negative relative strength): asset **under-performs** the benchmark

## 5. Trend, Support, and Resistance Lines

- Uptrend:
  - prices reach higher highs and higher lows.
  - demand > supply
  - draw: connecting the `<u>`increasing low points `</u>` with smooth straight line
- Downtrend
  - prices reach lower lows and lower highs.
  - supply > demand
  - draw: connect the `<u>`decreasing highs `</u>` in price with smooth straight line.
- Consolidation(Sideways Trend): when uptrend and downtrend are both not so in evidence.
- Trendline: help to identify whether a trend is continuing or reversing.
  - breakdown(from uptrend): downtrend will occur
  - breakup(from downtrend): uptrend will occur
- Support Level: **buying** is expected to emerge that `<u>`prevents further price decreases `</u>`不是很好理解
- Resistance Level: **selling** is expected to emerge that `<u>`prevents further price increases `</u>`
  - Support and Resistance levels are related to _psychologically importance prices_, such as `<u>`round-number prices `</u>` or `<u>`historical highs/lows `</u>`
- Changes in Polarity 极性变化
  - once support level is breached 有缺口, it often becomes a new resistance level
  - once resistance level is breached, it often becomes a new support level

## 6. Common Chart Patterns🌟

- Reversal patterns 逆转
  - Definition: occur when a trend approaches a range of prices *but fails to continue* beyond that range.
  - Example:
    - Head-and-shoulders pattern
      - the driving uptrend demand is fading
      - goal to use: use size project a `<u>`price target `</u>` for ensuring downtrend, which is the different between `<u>`head and neckline `</u>`
        - Terms:
          - head: highest price reached
          - neckline: support level between left shoulder and head
          - shoulder: `<u>`right `</u>` shoulder and `<u>`left `</u>` shoulder
        - Decision Rule:
          - if price fall down out of neckline, after the *right* shoulders-->**downtrend** is projected to continue from the *breakdown price* by the `<u>`size of head-and-shoulder pattern `</u>`--> We get the `<u>`price target `</u>`
    - Inverse head and shoulders pattern:
      - to predict the reversal pattern for downtrend
      - also called `<u>`head-and-shoulder bottom `</u>`
      - Target = Neckline + (Neckline − Head)
    - Double tops and bottoms pattern
      - Double tops:
        - weakening in buy pressure that has been driving an uptrend
        - price reaches to a `<u>`resistance level `</u>`, selling pressure appears repeatedly, preventing further price increases
        - the size can be used to project a next *downtrend price target*
    - Triple top and bottoms pattern
      - Triple tops is similar as double
- Continuation Pattern 持续: a pause in trend，而不是反转
  - Triangle
    - types:
      - symmetrical: higher lows+lower highs
      - ascending: higher lows + resistance level
      - descending: lower highs + support level
    - suggests buying and selling pressure becomes roughly 暂时的equal
    - size of triangle(difference between two trendlines): used to project a price target, where previous trend continues.
  - Rectangle
    - when trading temporarily forms a range between `<u>`support and resistance level `</u>`
    - suggest previous trend will continue
    - used to set a target price
  - Flag, Pennants: appear in short-term price chart
  - health correlation pattern

## 7. Common Technical Indicators🌟

- Price-Based Indicators
  - Moving average lines
    - Calculation: mean of last n closing prices
    - larger n chosen, smoother the moving average line, the more short-term fluctuations are removed, more obscure changes in prices trend 解读趋势就更为晦涩
    - usually make trading days `n=20` per month, `n=250` per year
    - uptrend: price > MA; downtrend: price <u MA
    - often viewed as `support or resistance levels`
    - golden cross:
      - short term average cross **above** long term average
      - indicator of `uptrend` appearance, `buy` signal
    - dead cross:
      - short term average cross **below** long term average
      - indicator of `downtrend` appearance, `sell` signal
  - Bollinger bands
    - Constructed by the `<u>`standard deviation of closing prices `</u>` over last n periods
    - draw: high:$2\sigma+MA$; low:$-2\sigma+MA$;mid:$MA$
    - Overbought: prices ≥ upper band→too high, likely to decrease in the near future 盛极必衰
    - Oversold: prices ≤ lower band→too low, likely to increase in the near future
    - Trading Strategy: contrarian strategy 逆向策略(别人恐惧我贪婪)
      - price at lower bollinger band, buy
      - price at higher bollinger band, sell
    - Standard Deviation: Changes in price volatility show the `<u>`distance between upper and lower bollinger bands `</u>`
    - **❗️Bollinger Band Width Indicator**= (upper band-lower band)/MA \*100%
    - 'squeeze': `<u>`volatility `</u>` falls to very `<u>`low levels `</u>` and _prices_ are expected to _breakout_.
  - Momentum Oscillators 振荡器:
    - Definition: group of indicators to identify overbought or oversold market
    - Extreme high values of oscillators, **overbought** market; Extreme low values of oscillators, **oversold** market.
    - `Convergence` of market price:
      - when oscillators show the _same_ patterns as prices
      - price trend is likely to be `<u>`continue `</u>`
    - `Divergence` of market price:
      - when oscillators show _difference_ patterns as prices
      - price trend will have a `<u>`change `</u>`
    - Example:
      - ROC Oscillators（rate of change)
        - Calculation: ROC=100\*(most recent closing price-closing price n periods ago)
        - around 100
        - trading stategy:
          - Buy: oscillator changes from `<u>`negative to positive `</u>` during a **uptrend** in prices
          - Sell: oscillator changes from `<u>`positive to negative `</u>` during a **downtrend** in prices
      - RSI(relative strength index)
        - calculation: RSI=100-[100/(1+RS)], where RS = Average gain/Average loss
        - range:$[0,100]$
        - RSI>70, overbought market
        - RSI<30, oversell market
        - **Positive divergence** occurs when security price reaches at new low, while RSI reaches a higher low. Inner momentum is `<u>`improving `</u>`. Selling pressure decreases.
        - **Opposite divergence** occurs when security price reaches a new high, while RSI fails to do that. Inner momentum is `<u>`fading `</u>`. Buying pressure decreases.
        - Different from relative strength analysis which compares **two** assets performance. RSI measures `<u>`inner strength `</u>` of a *single* asset.
      - MACD(moving average convergence/divergence)
        - Two lines

          - MACD=$MA_{close,t=12d}$-$MA_{close,t=26d}$, difference between short term MA and long term MA of security's prices.
          - Signal line= exponential smooth average of MACD line, t=9days
        - Treat EMA(26) as 0-axis
        - Three transaction signals:

          1. Intersection between DIF and EMA

          - bullish crossover: MACD crosses up through average line, buy
          - bearish crossover: MACD crosses down average line, sell

          2. Intersection between DIF and 0-axis(change in direction of a trend)

          - Bearish: change from positive to negative
          - Bullish: change from negative to positive

          3. Divergence between Stock price and DIF

          - Bullish divergence: price reaches at a new low, but MACD doesn't come to a new low of its own.
          - Bearish divergence: price reaches at a new high, but MACD doesn't come to a new high of its own.
      - Stochastic oscillators
        - Calculation:$\%K=100*(\frac{close-L_{t=14d}}{H_{t=14d}-L_{t=14d}})$
          - $close$: latest closing price
          - $L_{t=14d}$: lowest price in past 14 days
          - $H_{t=14d}$: highest price in past 14 days
        - Range:$[0,100]$
        - %D line: average of last 3 %K values calculated daily
          - like a long term MA, signal line similar to MACD
          - range:$[0,100]$
            - $\%D>80$, overbought market, bearish
            - $\%D<20$, oversold market, bullish
          - Trading signal:
            - %K line cross %D line from below to above it, bullish signal
            - %K line cross %D line from above to bellow it, bearish signal
        - Phenomena:
          - Sustainable uptrend, price trends close to recent high.
          - Sustainable downtrend, price trends close to recent low.
- Non-Price-Based(Sentiment) Indicators: for potential buyers and sellers
  - Put/Call Ratio
    - put options看跌期权: increase, when underlying assets price decrease
    - call options看涨期权: increase, when underlying assets price increase
    - The **volume** of put and call options reflect the activity by investors with `<u>`negative/positive `</u>` looks
    - Formula: Put-Call Ratio=Put Volume/Call Volume
      - p/c ratio↑, negative outlook for price of assets
        - Extremely high, bearish investors sentiment, oversold market
        - Extremely low, bullish investors sentiment, overbought market
      - a contrarian indicator
  - Volatility Index恐慌指标
    - the volatility of options on S&P500 stock index
    - high VIX, investor `<u>`fear declines `</u>` in market.了解市场未来30天波动状况
    - a contrarian indicator
  - Margin Debt
    - Definition: amount of money an investor *borrows from broker* via a margin account
    - *Increase* in amount of margin debt suggest `<u>`aggressive buying `</u>` by *bullish* margin investors.
    - if the amount of MD `<u>`up to limit `</u>`, the prices will begin **decline**.
    - Investors need to sell securities to meet `<u>`margin call `</u>`, which means the demands for additional capital or securities. These operations make price decreases lower.
    - margin debt↑, market price↑.

## 8. Intermarket Analysis Principles

- Definition: interrelationships among market values of major assets types. Apply the *relative strength analysis* to find `<u>`outperforming asset class `</u>`.
- Relative Strength Charts
  - Goal: determine which asset class/market are outperforming others.
  - uptrend: outperforming a benchmark

## 9. Technical Analysis Portfolio Management Application

- Top-down: begin from researching country or international regions' economic growth->markets or sectors outperforming use intermarket analysis
- Bottom-up:identifying an investment universe or opportunity set->set and narrow the criteria with technical analysis indicators and chart patterns
