## 1. Elasticity

### Price, Income, Cross-price Elasticities of Demand and Factors

- Own-Price Elasticity
  - Definition: responses of quantity demanded to change of price
  - Calculation: % $\Delta$ Quantity Demand/ % $\Delta$ Price
    - |Own-price Elasticity|>1, demand is elastic
    - |Own-price Elasticity|<1, demand is inelastic
    - Two extreme case: 
      - perfectly elastic demand, elasticity=0, demand shows a <u>vertical</u> line, with x-axis: Q, y-axis: P
      - perfectly inelastic demand, elasticity=$\infty$, demand shows a <u>horizontal</u> line, with x-axis: Q, y-axis: P
  - Traits: **downward sloping** demand, own-price elasticity *negative*
