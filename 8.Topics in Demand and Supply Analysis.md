## 1. Elasticity

### Price, Income, Cross-price Elasticities of Demand and Factors

- Own-Price Elasticity
  - Definition: responses of quantity demanded to change of price
  - Calculation: % $\Delta$ Quantity Demand/ % $\Delta$ Price
    - |Own-price Elasticity|>1, demand is elastic
    - |Own-price Elasticity|<1, demand is inelastic
    - Two extreme case: 
      - perfectly elastic demand, elasticity=0, demand shows a <u>vertical</u> line, with x-axis: Q, y-axis: P
      - perfectly inelastic demand, elasticity=$\infty$, demand shows a <u>horizontal</u> line, with x-axis: Q, y-axis: P
  - Factors Affect Elasticity
    - Quality and Availability of substitutions
      - if there are **few or no** substitutes, the goods' demand trend is relative `inelastic`.‰∏çÂèØÊõø‰ª£ÊÄßÂº∫ÔºåÈúÄÊ±ÇÂèó‰ª∑Ê†ºÂΩ±ÂìçÂ∞è
      - if the goods have **several or good** substitutes, the demand trend is `elastic`
    - Time: longer time period, larger elasticity
    - Portion of income spent on good
      - <u>larger portion</u> of income spent on the good, the <u>more elastic</u> of demand on it.
    - Goods Necessity: demand for **necessary goods** is relative inelastic, while for **consumer goods** the demand is elastic.ÁîüÊ¥ªÂøÖÈ°ªÂìÅÔºåÊ∂àË¥πÂìÅ
  - Traits: **downward sloping** demand, own-price elasticity *negative*
    - Elasticity != slope of demand curve(Èô§‰∫ÜextremeÈÇ£‰∏§‰∏™cases)
  - Graph Interpretation:
    - X-axes: Quantity of Demand, Y-axis: Price
    - upper part alone line: |Own-price Elasticity|>1
    - lower part alone line: |Own-price Elasticity|<1
    - When Own-price Elasticity=**-1**(Unit Elasticity), the point reaches *largest total revenue*(P*Q)
    - if demand curve steeper, be relatively more inelastic
    - if demand curve flatter, be relatively more elastic
- Income Elasticity of Demand
  - Definition: sensitivity of quantity demand to a change in income. 
  - Interpretation: 1% increase in income will lead to an increase/decrease of xx% in quantity of goods demand.
  - Calculation: % $\Delta$ Quantity Demand/ % $\Delta$ Income
  - Types:
    - Normal Goods: income elasticity>0
    - Inferior Goods: income elasticity<0
- Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand
  - Definition: the % $\Delta$ in quantity demand of *a good* to % $\Delta$ in the price of a <u>related good</u>
    - Common Relationship between Two Goods
      - Substitution: 
        - a related goods price‚Üë, demand of a good‚Üë
        - Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand>0
      - Complements:
        - a related goods price‚Üë, demand of a good‚Üì
        - Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand<0
- Elasticity CalculationÂ∫îÁî®È¢òÂàÜÈò∂ÊÆµÈÄâÊã©ÊÄß‰ª£Êï∞
  - Price Elasticity: $\frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P}=\frac{\Delta Q/Q_0}{\Delta P/P_0}=\frac{P_0}{Q_0}*\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}$
    - $\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}$: **slope** of <u>linear demand function</u>($Q=b_0+b_1*P$)
      - Demand curve:
        - the inverse of demand function
        - $P=1/b_1*Q+b_2$ÊñúÁéáÊòØÂÄíÊï∞

## 2. Demand and Supply

### Substitution Effect VS Income Effect

- Substitution effect: price of Good X‚Üì, shift consumptions towards more of Good X
- Income effect: price of Good X‚Üì, <u>total expenditure</u> on customer's original <u>bundles</u> of goods‚Üì. Specifically, the consumption of Good X ‚Üì ‚ÜëÈÉΩÊúâÂèØËÉΩ.
- Specific situations:
  - substitution effect positive, income effect positive, Good X consumption ‚Üë
  - substitution effect positive, income effect negative but smaller than substitution effect, Good X consumption ‚Üë
  - substitution effect positive, income effect negative but larger than substitution effect, Good X consumption ‚Üì

### Normal Goods VS Inferior Goods

- A specific good can be an <u>inferior good</u> for some region of income and <u>normal good</u> for other range of income
- Giffen good: 
  - price‚Üì, income effect>substitution effect, an inferior good.
  - upward sloping demand curve
- Veblen good:
  - the higher price makes the good more desirable
  - Reasons: customers get utility from <u>high status</u> brought from high price.
  - upward sloping demand curve
  - violate the theory of customer choice, thanks to its <u>availability limit</u> or *price rasing without restriction*
  - not a inferior good
  - ‚ùóÔ∏èsubstitution effect and income effect of price ‚Üë, goods consumption ‚Üì

### Diminishing Marginal Returns

- production factors: land,labor($L$),capital($K$ physical capital), materials
- production function: **the quantity of output(Y)** the company can produced with the function of **labor employed and amount of capital(X).**
  - Cost of production: $TC=wL+rK$
    - given level of output, 2 ways lower the cost of production:
      - input productivity ‚Üë
      - input price ‚Üì
- Total product($Q$), average product($\frac{Q}{L}$), marginal product($\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta L}$)
- Marginal product of labor:
  - Definition: keep capital amount fixed, the output with increasing one unit of labor.
  - Graph:
    - X-axis: Quantity of Labor; Y-axis: Total output
    - concave production function
  - Performance:üåü
    - at low range of labor input, *marginal product of labor increasing* and *positive*(slope upward)
    - Continue to add numbers of labor, at some point, the additional output from additional worker < previous worker's output, *marginal product decreasing* but still *positive* (slope upward‰ΩÜÊòØÂπÖÂ∫¶Ê≤°Êúâ‰πãÂâçÂ§ß‰∫Ü)
    - *Diminishing marginal productivity(return)* point: beyond this point, additional output of each additional labor begins to **decline**, marginal product of labor *negative.* (slope downward)

### Breakeven and Shutdown Points

<https://ift.world/booklets/economics-topics-in-demand-and-supply-analysis-part3/>

- short term: the time period over some production factors are fixed
- long-term: All factors of production (costs) are *variable*. 
- Under Perfect Competition 
  - Breakeven Point: price=marginal revenue=average revenue, making economic profit=0, AR‰∏éATCÁöÑ‰∫§ÁÇπA
    - Economic profit=total revenue-total cost
    - Economic profit=accounting profit-total implicit opportunity cost
    - accounting profit=total revenue-total accounting cost
    - Accounting profit=economic profit + normal profit
  - Shutdown: 
    - Short-term Shutdown Point(breakeven point)‰∏¥ÁïåÁÇπ:as soon as items <u>sold price(AR)</u>< <u>average variable cost(AVC)</u>,but AR< ATC, firm's losses>fixed costs, firm should continue to operate in short run, even if it losses, but it should shutdown in long run.
    - Long-term Shutdown Point:as soon as items <u>sold price(AR)</u>< <u>average total cost(ATC)</u>
  - Graph:
    - X-axis: Product per day, Y-axis: Cost
    - At point A, price(@P1 level):average revenue=average total cost
    - price>P1: economic profit>0
    - price< P1: economic profit<0
- Under Imperfect Competition
  - Imperfect competition: **marginal revenue != price**, so use *Total Cost & total Revenue* is a good measures for Breakeven and Shutdown analysis.
  - Breakeven: TR=TC(@$Q_{BE1}$ and $Q_{BE2}$)
  - Continue to operate in short run but shut down in long run: TC>TR>TVC
  - Shut down in both short and long run: TR< TVC
  - Economic profit is maximized @$Q_{max}$ level
  - if entire `TC>TR`, minimize losses in short run by operating at quantity corresponding to the <u>smallest TR-TC</u>

### Economies of Effect & Diseconomies of Scale Affect Costs

- company size is fixed in short run, while, in long run, firms can choose the **most profitable scale** of operationÁîü‰∫ßËßÑÊ®°
- Graph:
  - X-axis: quantity of output, Y-axis: dollar
  - $LRATC$ long-run average total cost: 
    - each point lies on this line means the minimum ATC for given scale
    - big U-shape convex line, first decrease, then increase
      - downward sloping->increasing returns to scale, **economies of scale**
        - Factors: 
          - labor specification
          - mass production
          - investment on more efficient equipment and technology
          - negotiate power ‚Üë for lower input prices with supplier
        - result: increase competitiveness by production expansion and cost reduction
      - upward sloping->**diseconomies of scale**
        - Factors:
          - bureaucracy increases, inefficiency‚Üë
          - motivating and managing large workforce is difficult
          - innovation barriers
        - result: firm wants to <u>decrease the output</u> and move back to minimum efficient scale.
      - relative flat portion at bottom->constant returns to scale
    - **Minimum Effect Scale**:
      - lowest point on $LRATC$, average total cost of production at a minimum
      - under perfect competition market, LRATC=market price, in long run, earn 0 economics profit
  - $SRATC$ short-run average total cost: 
    - scale of operation of $SRATC_{n+1}>SRATC_{n}$
