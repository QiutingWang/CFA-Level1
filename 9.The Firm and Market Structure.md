# Reading9 The Firm and Market Structures

With four types of market structures,we compare them from: *numbers of firm, firm demand elasticity, pricing power, long-run economic profits, barriers to entry, amount of product differentiation, advertising* perspectives.

## 1. Perfect Competition

- Characteristics of perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, pure monopoly
  - Factors:
    1. number of firms and their size
    2. firms' product degree of differentiation
    3. bargaining power of firms with respect to pricing
    4. barriers to entry into or exit from the industry
    5. Other competition factors of firms except price level除价格外的企业竞争因素
  - Perfect Competition:
    - many firms produce *identical* products
    - <u>perfectly elastic</u> demand curve, since no single firm is large enough to affect market price
  - Monopolistic Competition:
    - products are not identical with different combination of marketing, features, quality
    - prices not identical
    - demand curve downward sloping, no perfectly elastic
  - Oligopoly
    - each firm must consider actions and responses of other firms in setting price and business strategy竞争对手少而精 interdependent公司策略相互影响
    - the economies of scale leads to <u>large size</u > companies in this kind market寡头公司数量小规模大(few dominated firms)
  - Monopoly
    - downward sloping demand curve
    - Power Source: normally support by government
      - copyrights and patents protection
      - control over a resources specially needed掌握稀缺资源
    - natural monopoly: production average cost is higher than customer demand.这个时候如果再来一个类似的生产者，对市场和消费者的损害很大。
      - eg: electric power, distribution business or other public utilities
    - private owned monopoly companies are regulated by government.
  - Market Power:
    - Network effect/synergies协作: difficult to compete with other company once reach a critical <u>level of market penetration</u>.
    - Competition: 
      - have a moat护城河 to protect them from competition
      - market share is downward sloping
    - Factors: technology and customer taste changes, reduce market power

| :-------- | :--------  | :-----  | :-----|:-----: |
|Number of Sellers| Many| Many|Few|Single|
|Barrier to Entry|Very Low|Low| High|Very High|

- Relationship between Price, Marginal Revenue(MR), Marginal Cost(MC), Economic Profit, Demand Elasticity under different market structures, Optimal price and output, Factors affecting long-run equilibrium 
  - Perfect Competition
    - Price-taker Demand curve: horizontal, perfectly elastic
      - Demand=MR=AR(average revenue)
      - MR is Price, in pure competitive market, MR=market price
    - Optimal: maximum profit and output
      - $Q^ *$: when $MR=MC$
    - **Economic profit**=Total Revenue-Opportunity Cost of production
      - opportunity cost of production: include cost of normal return to all factors of production
      - Short-Run maximum:
        - Marginal approach: when $MC=MR$
        - Total approach: when $(TR-TC)_{max}$
      - Economic loss: $MR< MC$ or $price< ATC$
        - in short run, firms will continue to run the company, when $AVC <Price< ATC$
        - if $Price≤ AVC$, firms will shutdown in short run and long run, to eliminate fixed costs.
      - firms <u>do not earn economic profit</u>,only **normal profit** is realized, owning to new firms will enter industry to earn economics profit, reducing market price. Finally, $Market \space Price=MR=ATC=MC$, where ATC at the lowest value.
      - **Short run supply curve**: both of them slope upward to the right
        - for a firm: MC line above AVC
        - whole market: 
          - horizontal <u>sum</u> of MC curves for all firms in given industry. Firms will *supply more* units at *higher prices*.
          - the intercept with y-axis: the price level of firms' AVC and MC interception

- Changes in Demand, Entry & Exit, Plant Size
  - in short run, right shift of market demand(increase), causing both equilibrium price and quantity increased. 
  - Equilibrium **price** increase for individual firm, **demand** curve increase, profit-maximizing **output** $Q^*$ increased.
    - firms will *earn economic profit* in *short* run
    - in long run, firms will <u>increase the scale</u> of operations, new firms will entry into this industry.反之，exit the industry, decrease the scale(**downsizing**)
      - new firms enter, **industry supply curve** shift right **down**, supply increased->equilibrium output increase,equilibrium price decrease->will produce less->individual firm <u>move down</u> own <u>supply curve</u>->firm total revenue and economic profit decrease
  - If firm suffers **economic loss**, some firms exit market-><u>decrease industry supply</u> and increase equilibrium price-> remaining firm move up supply curve, production increase at higher price->total revenue of these firms increase->economic loss reduced
  - Permanent change in demand

## 2. Monopolistic Competition

- Characteristics:
  - only pay attention to average price, no individual firm has power to influence price significantly...in table above
- demand curve
  - downward sloping
  - highly elastic
- Output Decision for a Firm
  - short run: 
    - Maximum economic profit $Q^*$: when $MR=MC$
    - if $P^*>ATC^*$, earns economic profits->new competitors will enter to the industry
  - long run:
    - after new firms enter market->shift demand curve down until $P^*=ATC^*$, means economic profit=0->long-run reach equilibrium
- Comparison with Perfect Competition:
  - **markup**: price>MC
  - **excess capacity/inefficient scale of production**: ATC not a minimum for quantity produced, and **price is slightly higher** than perfect competition(because of <u>product differentiation</u> in Monopolistic Competition)
  - Long-term equilibrium point($Q^*$): when $P^*=ATC^*$, while PC is when $MR=MC$
- Differentiation Methods:
  - product innovation: 
    - with relative <u>less elastic</u> demand curve to *increase prices and economic profits* until the occurrence of <u>close substitutes and imitations</u>
    - consider the cost of innovation and extra revenue earned(IRR), optimal point of spend on innovation: $MC=MR$
  - advertising expenses
    - <u>normally high</u> in this market structure, to tell customers the unique features or increase a perception of differences even if actually products are quite similar.
    - ATC attribute to advertising decrease,if sales quantity increase
  - brand names
    - provide information to customers by providing them the <u>quality signal</u>

## 3. Oligopoly寡头垄断

- Kinked demand curve model
  - Assumptions: *increase* in firm's *product price* will **not** followed by its competitors, but price decreasing will.
  - Graph Interpretation:
    - **more elastic(flatter)** <u>above</u>(斜率绝对值较小) a given price than it **below**(斜率绝对值较大)the kink price($P_k$), where firm produces at $Q_k$ level
    - profit maximizing point: kink point$(Q_k,P_k)$
    - The reasons behind different abs_slope:
      - when price below kink price, other firms will follow the price cutting strategy. Hence, all firms experience the relative <u>small increase in sales</u> response to price reduction.->[less elastic]
      - When the firm raise up pice above $P_k$, the *competitors still stay at kink point*, leading to losing this firm's market share.(align with assumption)
    - Gap between Demand Curve and Marginal Revenue Curve
      - @kink point$(Q_k,P_k)$
      - Two marginal cost curves $MC_A$ and $MC_B$ pass through the gap
        - normally MR=MC reaches the maximum profit
- Cournot duopoly model
  - Assumption: two firms with <u>identical marginal cost</u> curves, each prefer to choose selling price based in **other firm set in pervious period**(benchmark).
  - each firm sell the same amounts, same quality, market share is splatted equally at <u>equilibrium price</u>. 
  - Comparison between Perfect Competition, Monopoly, Oligopoly
    - Equilibrium price: $P_{EperfectCompetition}<P_{Ecournot}<P_{Emonopoly}$
    - perfect competition market equilibrium: highest quantity, lowest price
    - monopoly market equilibrium: highest price, lowest price
- Nash equilibrium model
  - Reach condition: there is no other choice that makes any firm better off(profits↑, losses↓)
  - Case: two company, each company can choose charge low/high price
    - collusion共谋，increase both firms' interests. 
      - In reality, firms can <u>enter into or enforce an agreement</u> about pricing and output, which are <u>illegal</u> in some country, owing to its competition reduction.
        - eg: collusive agreement OPEC **cartel**, reducing oil production to rise up the prices. But some members will privately cheat on the agreement with enlarge production.
        - The <u>situation/condition</u> when collusive agreement increasing price successfully:
          - fewer firms
          - similar products, less differentiation
          - similar cost structure
          - small and frequent purchase
          - Cheating retaliation背叛报复 is certain and sever
          - less actual or potential competition from outside the cartel.
- Stackelberg dominant firm model
  - Assumption: one firm is the leader(market share>=40%), who choose the price first, the other firm chooses a price based on leader's price.Namely, **benchmark: leader's price.**
  - leader chooses a <u>higher price</u>, receiving a greater proportion of profits.
  - Dominant Firm(DF) Model, Graph Interpretation:
    - Price-taker: CF, other competitive firms; Price-searcher: DF
    - $D_{DF}$: Dominant firm demand curve; $MR_{DF}$; $MC_{DF}$
      - the interception point's X position is $Q_{DF}$ level, find the optimal price $P^*$ with the point on $D_{DF}$ given $Q_{DF}$. At this point, reach at profit maximization.
    - market demand curve in the graph
    - price of CF↓, in short run, $Q_{CF}$ ↑ -> price of DF↓ ->CF will <u>decrease output or exit</u> the industry in long run, owing to market share of CF ↓, market share of DF ↑因为total market demand变小了，$D_{DF}$与market demand在同一price level的gap也缩小.
  - Collusion VS Perfect Competition竞争与协作的程度
    - two interceptions:
      - market marginal cost & market demand->$(Q_{competition},P_{competition})$
        - no economic profit
      - market marginal revenue & market marginal cost->$Q_{collusive}$, with this quantity level find the $P_{collusive}$ level on Market Demand curve.
        - at Monopoly price, *maximize total profits* to all firms in the market.

## 4. Monopoly and Concentration

- Characteristic:
  - Downward sloping curve
    - if set single price, it need to be at low level to gain a great quantity
    - the **price quantity** both need to be <u>trade-off</u> for getting maximum profits. 
      - in perfect competition market, firm is price taker.
  - Two pricing strategies:
    - single price
      - Profit maximum point reaches when $MC=MR$
        - $MR=P(1-\frac{1}{E_p})$
          - $P$: current price
          - $E_p$: absolute value of price elasticity of demand @P
        - **single-price profit-maximizing output**:when $MR=P(1-\frac{1}{E_p})=MC$ at $Q^*$
          - at this interception quantity level, find the corresponding price level $P^*$ at demand curve. 
          - at this interception quantity level, find the corresponding price level $ATC^*$ at ATC curve. 
          - $P^*$>$ATC^*$->Economic Profit=$(P^*$-$ATC^*)* Q^*$
      - *long-run* positive economic profits can exit, for no new competitors enter
      - Price searcher Monopolists have <u>imperfect information</u> about market, the *extra experiment* with *different pricing levels* is needed.
    - price discrimination
      - motivation: capture more customers surplus as economic profit
      - Conditions to make it efficient for adding firm interests:
        - downward sloping demand curve
        - at least 2 groups of customers with different <u>price elasticities</u> of demand
        - avoid customers get the products through <u>reselling with lower price</u> than original selling price.
      - Graph Interpretation:
        - with price discrimination with 2 groups of customers, sales quantity↑, economic profits↑
        - Deadweight Loss: 
          - the triangle constructed by demand curve, MC/ATC, sales quantity
          - customers and suppliers total surplus
          - Monopoly is thought `inefficient`, because of comparison with perfect complete, it reduces total surplus.
            - In detail, customer surplus is reduced, because monopoly increase price and decrease quantity.
          - Price discrimination <u>reduces this inefficiency</u> by enlarging sales quantity
      - Extreme case: Perfect Price Discrimination理论上，实际很少有
        - Definition: charge <u>each customers' maximum</u> they are willing to pay for each unit
        - no DWL, no consumer surplus
  - Monopoly VS Perfect competition Graph Interpretation
    - Perfect competition:
      - Industry supply curve($S$): <u>sum</u> of supply curve of many competing firms in industry.
      - Equilibrium: the interception of market suppl($S$) and market demand($D$) curves @$(Q_{PC},P_{PC})$
    - Monopoly:
      - facing the same demand curve and marginal cost curve
      - Maximum point: the interception of $MR$ and $MC$, get $(Q_{MON},P_{MON})$
      - in graph, Supply curve=Marginal cost curve
    - Comparison: 
      - From equilibrium respect, monopoly produces less output, but charges a higher price. 
      - DWL: monopoly creates DWL because
        - doesn't maximize the sum of consumer and producer surplus
        - **rent seeking**: producer spends time and resources to try to acquire or establish a monopoly.
  - Natural Monopoly
    - Definition: 
      - economics of production leads to a <u>single firm</u> supplying the *entire market demand*.
      - the average cost of production is falling in the relevant range of consumer demand.(因为提供的量大，原来总成本很高，但平均下来就很小了)
    - Graph Interpretation:
      - profit maximize: when $MR=MC$ get $(Q_U,P_U)$
      - given economies of scale, if one additional company enters the market, ATC ↑.
      - When `long run average cost` is decreasing, there exists potential gain from monopoly, thanks to ATC ↓
    - Regulators Operations:
      - <u>increase competition and efficiency</u> to reduce artificial barriers to trade
        - eg: licensing requirements, quotas, tariffs
      - set the pricing level that monopoly needs to charge
        - Goal: monopolists produce < optimal quantity level, government wants to *improve resource allocation efficiency*.
        - Method:注意这两个的名字命名都是和交线相关的
          - Average Cost Pricing
            - most common form
            - The interception of $ATC$ and $D$ @$(Q_{AC},P_{AC})$
              - output↑, price↓
              - social welfare, allocation efficiency↑
              - ensure monopolist a `normal profit`, thanks to $price=ATC$保底的有了
          - Marginal Cost Pricing
            - efficient regulation
            - interception of $MC$ and $D$ @$(Q_{MC},P_{MC})$
              - output↑, price↓
              - incur losses, owing to $price< ATC$. <u>Government subsidiary</u> is required, for providing normal profit and avoiding firm exits the market.
          - Comparison: $Q_U< Q_{AC}< Q_{UC}$, $P_{UC}< P_{AC}< P_{U}$
      - Sell monopoly right to highest bidder
        - Bid winner will be an efficient supplier
          - bid amount=value of expected economic profit
          - price=long-run average cost
- Supply Function Summary
  - Perfect competition
    - Short-run(firm): the part of MC curve which above AVC curve
    - Short-run(market): sum the quantities supplied across all firms
    - $Price=MR$
  - monopolistic competition, oligopoly, and monopoly: 
    - <u>no</u> defined supply function.
    - downward sloping demand curve
      - quantity supplied@interception of $MC$ and $MR$
      - price charge: the same supplied quantity level at *Demand* curve
- Pricing Strategy Summary(optimal cases)
  - Perfect competition: $MC=MR=Price$
  - Monopoly: $MC=MR$,but they$< Price$
  - Monopoly Competition: $MC=MR$,but they$< Price$
  - Oligopoly: depends on the assumptions about how interdependent is
    - Kinked demand curve: kinked point$(Q_k,P_k)$
    - Collusion: if they agree to <u>share the market and economic profits</u> to get maximum profit
      - get Quantity level: intersection of $MC$ and $MR$
      - charge the price at the quantity level we get above on **Demand** curve.
    - Dominant firm model
      - Price searcher: DF ge the quantity sold when $MC=MR$, price charging level at the quantity level we get before on **Demand** curve
      - Price taker: CF, take the price, produce the *quantity* when $MC=price$.
    - Game theory: $P_{mon}>P_{oli}>P_{perfectCom}$
- Concentration Measures in Market Structure Identification Usage and Limitations
  - Goal: measure the pricing power of firms
  - Estimate elasticity of demand
  - percentage of market sales(**market share**): 
    - to measure degree of monopoly or market power of a firm
    - in some industries, M&A in the same industry is illegal, because of too high market share harmful to economy.
  - **Concentration measures**(indicators)
    - **N-firm concentration ratio**
      - Calculation: <u>sum or percentage market shares</u> of largest N firms in a market
      - Drawback: less sensitive to mergers of 2 firms with large market shares如果行业里有两个大公司合并了，这个indicator前后变化表现的不明显
    - **Herfindahl-Hirschman Index(HHI)**
      - Calculation: sum of squares of market shares of the largest firms in the market
      - Drawback: not consider potential competitors and barriers to entry
