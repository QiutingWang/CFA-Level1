# Reading9 The Firm and Market Structures

With four types of market structures,we compare them from: *numbers of firm, firm demand elasticity, pricing power, long-run economic profits, barriers to entry, amount of product differentiation, advertising* perspectives.

## 1. Perfect Competition

- Characteristics of perfect competition, monopolistic competition, oligopoly, pure monopoly
  - Factors:
    1. number of firms and their size
    2. firms' product degree of differentiation
    3. bargaining power of firms with respect to pricing
    4. barriers to entry into or exit from the industry
    5. Other competition factors of firms except price level除价格外的企业竞争因素
  - Perfect Competition:
    - many firms produce *identical* products
    - <u>perfectly elastic</u> demand curve, since no single firm is large enough to affect market price
  - Monopolistic Competition:
    - products are not identical with different combination of marketing, features, quality
    - prices not identical
    - demand curve downward sloping, no perfectly elastic
  - Oligopoly
    - each firm must consider actions and responses of other firms in setting price and business strategy竞争对手少而精 interdependent公司策略相互影响
    - the economies of scale leads to <u>large size</u > companies in this kind market寡头公司数量小规模大(few dominated firms)
  - Monopoly
    - downward sloping demand curve
    - Power Source: normally support by government
      - copyrights and patents protection
      - control over a resources specially needed掌握稀缺资源
    - natural monopoly: production average cost is higher than customer demand.这个时候如果再来一个类似的生产者，对市场和消费者的损害很大。
      - eg: electric power, distribution business or other public utilities
    - private owned monopoly companies are regulated by government.
  - Market Power:
    - Network effect/synergies协作: difficult to compete with other company once reach a critical <u>level of market penetration</u>.
    - Competition: 
      - have a moat护城河 to protect them from competition
      - market share is downward sloping
    - Factors: technology and customer taste changes, reduce market power

- Relationship between Price, Marginal Revenue(MR), Marginal Cost(MC), Economic Profit, Demand Elasticity under different market structures, Optimal price and output, Factors affecting long-run equilibrium 
  - Perfect Competition
    - Price-taker Demand curve: horizontal, perfectly elastic
      - Demand=MR=AR(average revenue)
      - MR is Price, in pure competitive market, MR=market price
    - Optimal: maximum profit and output
      - $Q^ *$: when $MR=MC$
    - **Economic profit**=Total Revenue-Opportunity Cost of production
      - opportunity cost of production: include cost of normal return to all factors of production
      - Short-Run maximum:
        - Marginal approach: when $MC=MR$
        - Total approach: when $(TR-TC)_{max}$
      - Economic loss: $MR< MC$ or $price< ATC$
        - in short run, firms will continue to run the company, when $AVC <Price< ATC$
        - if $Price≤ AVC$, firms will shutdown in short run and long run, to eliminate fixed costs.
      - firms <u>do not earn economic profit</u>,only **normal profit** is realized, owning to new firms will enter industry to earn economics profit, reducing market price. Finally, $Market \space Price=MR=ATC=MC$, where ATC at the lowest value.
      - **Short run supply curve**: both of them slope upward to the right
        - for a firm: MC line above AVC
        - whole market: 
          - horizontal <u>sum</u> of MC curves for all firms in given industry. Firms will *supply more* units at *higher prices*.
          - the intercept with y-axis: the price level of firms' AVC and MC interception

- Changes in Demand, Entry & Exit, Plant Size
  - in short run, right shift of market demand(increase), causing both equilibrium price and quantity increased. 
  - Equilibrium **price** increase for individual firm, **demand** curve increase, profit-maximizing **output** $Q^*$ increased.
    - firms will *earn economic profit* in *short* run
    - in long run, firms will <u>increase the scale</u> of operations, new firms will entry into this industry.反之，exit the industry, decrease the scale(**downsizing**)
      - new firms enter, **industry supply curve** shift right **down**, supply increased->equilibrium output increase,equilibrium price decrease->will produce less->individual firm <u>move down</u> own <u>supply curve</u>->firm total revenue and economic profit decrease
  - If firm suffers **economic loss**, some firms exit market-><u>decrease industry supply</u> and increase equilibrium price-> remaining firm move up supply curve, production increase at higher price->total revenue of these firms increase->economic loss reduced
  - Permanent change in demand

## 2. Monopolistic Competition

- Characteristics:
  - only pay attention to average price, no individual firm has power to influence price significantly...in table above
- demand curve
  - downward sloping
  - highly elastic
- Output Decision for a Firm
  - short run: 
    - Maximum economic profit $Q^*$: when $MR=MC$
    - if $P^*>ATC^*$, earns economic profits->new competitors will enter to the industry
  - long run:
    - after new firms enter market->shift demand curve down until $P^*=ATC^*$, means economic profit=0->long-run reach equilibrium
- Comparison with Perfect Competition:
  - **markup**: price>MC
  - **excess capacity/inefficient scale of production**: ATC not a minimum for quantity produced, and **price is slightly higher** than perfect competition(because of <u>product differentiation</u> in Monopolistic Competition)
  - Long-term equilibrium point($Q^*$): when $P^*=ATC^*$, while PC is when $MR=MC$
- Differentiation Methods:
  - product innovation: 
    - with relative <u>less elastic</u> demand curve to *increase prices and economic profits* until the occurrence of <u>close substitutes and imitations</u>
    - consider the cost of innovation and extra revenue earned(IRR), optimal point of spend on innovation: $MC=MR$
  - advertising expenses
    - <u>normally high</u> in this market structure, to tell customers the unique features or increase a perception of differences even if actually products are quite similar.
    - ATC attribute to advertising decrease,if sales quantity increase
  - brand names
    - provide information to customers by providing them the <u>quality signal</u>

## 4. Monopoly and Concentration
