## 1. Returns Measures

- Major Return Measures
  - Holding Period Return(HPR)
    - Formula: $HPR=end \space of \space period \space value/beginning \space of \space period \space value -1=\frac{P_t+Div_t}{P_0}-1=\frac{P_t-P_0+Div_t}{P_0}$
    - Definition: % increase in the value of investment in a specific time period
  - Average Returns
    - Arithmetic mean return=$\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nR_i}{n}$
    - Geometric mean return=$\sqrt[n]{\prod_{i=1}^n(1+R_i)}-1=\sqrt[n]{1+HPR}-1$
  - Gross Return: 
    - Definition: total return *before deduct* the management and administration fees of investment account
    - commissions on traders and other costs related to returns generation should be deducted.
  - Net Return: return after these fees deducted

  - After-tax Return: after the tax liability deducted
  - Real Return: 
    - nominal return adjusted for inflation
    - measures the increase in an investor's purchasing power
  - Leveraged Return: 
    - a multiple of the return on underlying asset
    - Calculation: gain or loss/cash investment *100%
    - common in <u>real state</u> industry: investors often pay a part of a property cost in cash and borrow the rest.

- Money- and Time-Weighted Return
  - Money-Weighted Return
    - IRR(take all cash inflows and outflows)
