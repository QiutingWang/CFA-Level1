# Reading63 Portfolio Risk and Return Part2

## 1. Systematic Risk and Beta

- CAL and CML
  - Capital Allocation Line
    - a line shows the combinations of risk-free asset and risky assets' risk and return 
    - $b_0$: $R_f$, and pass through risky assets/portfolios' risk and return。通常选择斜率最大的那条线为optimal
    - Assumption: investors have <u>homogeneous</u> expectations, facing the same efficient frontier of risky portfolios.
      - all investors use the **same** risky portfolios(that is the <u>optimal risky portfolio</u>), which is called **<u>market portfolio</u>** of all risky portfolios.
    - optimal risky portfolio point on CAL is **tangent** to efficient frontier.
  - Capital Market Line
    - Definition: <u>CAL which has optimal risky portfolio point</u> for all investors is CML.
    - $E(R_p)$ is a linear function of $\sigma_p$: $E(R_p)=R_f+({E(R_M)-R_f})\frac{\sigma_M}{\sigma_p}$
      - Market risk premium: $({E(R_M)-R_f})$
        - investors want to get one unit of market risk premium in additional return for every unit of market risk $\sigma_M$ that investors willing to accept
  - Borrowing and Lending Portfolio(Capital Market Theory)
    - at CML, find the point $M(\sigma_M,E(R_M))$, where $W_M=100$%, along the <u>left</u> of the line are **lending portfolios**($W_M<100$%), while lying on the <u>right</u> if the line are **borrowing portfolios**($W_M>100$%).
      - **lending portfolios**: the investment in the assets comes from <u>investors' own wealth</u> at $R_f$.
      - **borrowing portfolios**: investor is able to <u>borrow money</u> at $R_f$ to invest more market portfolio.
        - also called **leveraged portfolio**, more risk leads to higher expected return.
        - Sometimes, the borrowing rate is different from risk-free rate. The new slope of right part is $\frac{R_M-R_b}{\sigma_M}$
          - when $R_b>R_f$, return per risk is **less** than equal case.
  - Passive and Active Portfolio Management Stategy
    - Active
      - investors believe security value estimations are correct, market prices are incorrect. 
      - They **invest more** than market weights securties that they believe are <u>undervalued</u>, while **invest less** than market weights securites that they believe are <u>overvalued</u>.
      - They use market index as reference benchmark to adjust their investment decision.
    - Passive: market prices are informationally efficient, allocating more on risk-free asset

- Systematic and Nonsystematic Risk
  - Definition:
    - Nonsystematic Risk: the risk can be eliminated by diversification.
      - Also called *firm-specific, diversifiable, unique risk*
    - Systematic Risk: risk remains cannot be diversified away. Also called *nondiversifiable risk* or *market risk*.
    - Total Risk= Nonsystematic risk + Systematic risk
      - when numbers of securities in portfolio reach up to `30`, the total risk approximate to systematic risk.
  - Systematic Risk is Relevant in Portfolios
    - The <u>riskiest stock</u> with the measure of std of returns **not always means** gains <u>greatest expected return</u>.
    - Capital Market Theory: Equilibrum security returns more depend on stocks' **systematic risk**.
      - Nonsystematic risk is **not** so related to equilibrum, thanks to its can be **eliminated** for free by diversification.
    - Systematic risk is measured by **contribution of a security** to the risk of well-diversified portfolio.

- Return Generating Models
  - Definition: estimate the expected returns on risky securities based on some factors with sensitivity coefficients.
  - Multifactor models: commonly use <u>macroeconomic</u> and <u>fundamental</u> factors. *Statistical factors* are **not** included into consideration.
    - Form: $E(R_i)-R_f=\beta_{i1}E(Factor_1)+\beta_{i2}E(Factor_2)+...+\beta_{ik}E(Factor_k)$
      - $\beta s$: factor sensitivity or factor loading
    - Example: Fama-French Three Factors, Carhart Four Factors(includes momentum)
  - Single-Factor Model: $E(R_i)-R_f=\beta_i*[E(R_m)-R_f]$, the relatinship with excess return on market index
    - Market Model
      - Formula: $R_i=\alpha_i+\beta_iR_m+e_i$
        - $R_m$: market return
        - $e_i$: abnormal return on asset $i$
        - $\beta_i$: how **sensitive** the return on Asset i is to the return on *market index*.
      - Intuition: to estimate a security's <u>beta</u> and <u>abnormal return</u> based on actual market return.

- $\beta$ Calculation
  - Definition: standardized measure of the covariance of the asset's return with market return
  - Formula: $\beta_i=\frac{Cov_{im}}{\sigma_m^2}$
    - Another expression:
      - Correlation between Asset i and market index: $\rho_{im}=\frac{Cov_{im}}{\sigma_i\sigma_m}$⇒ $Cov_{im}=\rho_{im}\sigma_i\sigma_m$
      - Then the previous one be rewriten as: $\beta_i=\rho_{im}(\frac{\sigma_i}{\sigma_m})$
  - Interpretation: 
    - $\beta>0$ return of asset follows the market trend; 
    - $\beta< 0$ opposite the market trend; 
    - $\beta=0$: no correlation with the market;
    - $\beta=1$: asset return has the same volatility as market trend.
  - Security Characteristic Line
    - slope: $\beta_i$, namely, $\frac{Cov_{im}}{\sigma_m^2}$.
    - axis: 
      - x: market excess return $(R_m-R_f)$
      - y: asset excess return $(R_i-R_f)$

## 2. The CAPM and SML(Security Market Line)

- CAPM, Assumptions, SML
  - Security Market Line(SML)
    - axis: $E(R_i)$ and $Cov_{i,m}$, which represents the systematic risk
    - Equation: $E(R_i)=R_f+\frac{E(R_m)-R_f}{\sigma_mkt^2}Cov_{i,mkt}$
      - intercept: $R_f$
      - pass through the market portfolio at $M(\sigma_{m}^2, E(R_{m}))$
      - Rewrite: $E(R_i)=R_f+\frac{Cov_{i,m}}{\sigma_{m}^2}[E(R_m)-R_f]$, where ratio can be treated as $\beta_i$
  - CAPM(Capital Asset Pricing Model)
    - axis: x: $\beta_i$ and $E(R_i)$
    - pass through $(0,R_f)$ and $M(1,E(R_{m}))$
    - Formula: $E(R_i)=R_f+\beta_i[E(R_m)-R_f]$
    - Assumptions:
      - Risk aversion
      - utility maximzing investors
      - Frictionless markets: no taxes, transaction costs, or other implediments to trading.
      - one-period horizon
      - homogeneous expectations
      - divisible assets
      - competitive markets: take market price as given, no investor can influence the trading prices.
  - Comparing the CML and SML
    - CML: only <u>efficient</u> portfolios plot on it. While, not well diversified plotted <u>inside</u> the efficient frontier.
    - SML: all properly priced securities will plot on it, thanks to all are determined by systematic risk.

- Application of CAPM and SML

- Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio, $M^2$, Jensen's Alpha
  - Attribution analysis: sources of returns differences between <u>active portfolio returns</u> and <u>passive benchmark portfolio</u>.
  - Sharpe Ratio:
    - $Sharpe=\frac{E(R_p)-R_f}{\sigma_p}$
    - a risk-adjusted portfolio performance
    - a pre-fact expectation values of returns and std OR ex-post measure of portfolio performance
    - =slope of CAL
  - M-Squared
    - Formula: $M^2=\frac{(R_p-R_f)\sigma_m}{\sigma_p}-(R_m-R_f)$
  - Treynor Measure
    - Formula: $\frac{R_p-R_f}{\beta_p}$
    - excess returns per unit of systematic risk, a measure of slope
  - Jensen's Alpha
    - Formula: $\alpha_p=R_p-[R_f+\beta_p(R_M-R_f)]$
    - percentage portfolio return above that of a portfolio with the same beta lies on SML.
      - actual portfolio return - expected return
