# Reading66 Introduction to Risk Management

## 1. Introduction to Risk Management

- Definition
   1. identify the risk tolerance 
   2. measure the risk that company faces
   3. modify and monitor the risks
  - return above risk-free rate is earned by taking on risk
  - return cannot under control, while specific or overall level risk can be under control
  - Goal: maximum the expected return given a certain level of risk
- Risk Management Framework Features
  - *process and policies* for risk governance
  - determine the *risk tolerance*
  - measure the *existing risks*
  - achieve *optimal* bundle of risk
  - monitor risk *exposure*
  - communication
  - perform strategic risk analysis
- Risk Governance and Elements
  - setting overall risk exposure
  - factor: 
    - negatives outside events, regulatory environment, financial strength, and ability to withstand losses.
  - risk from inside organization and from outside
- Risk Budget
  - Single metric: portfolio beta, value at risk, portfolio duration, returns variances
  - constructed by categories
  - identify specific risk factors that comprise the overall risk of the portfolio or organization
- Financial and non-financial risk
  - Financial risk
    - credit risk: uncertainty about whether counterparty to a transaction will <u>fulfill its contractual obligations</u>.
    - liquidity risk: loss of selling assets when *market price< fair value*
    - market risk: uncertainty of market prices of assets/stocks/commodity and interest rates.
  - Non-financial risk(from operations of organization and sources <u>external</u> to the organization)
    - operational risk:human error,faulty origination process, business interruptions.
      - eg: cyberËÆ°ÁÆóÊú∫ÊäÄÊúØ risk: disruptions of organization's information technology
    - solvency riskÂÅø‰ªòËÉΩÂäõ: unable to continue to operate owing to lack of money
    - regulatory risk: regulation environment change, cost increasing and set up additional restrictions
    - governmental/political risk
    - legal risk
    - model risk: asset valuation model's incorrect.
    - tail risk: uncertainty about the probability of **extreme**/negative outcomes
    - accounting risk: related to accounting policies and estimates are incorrect
  - Individuals
    - mortality risk: ÊèêÂâçprovide his family financial needs
      - reduced by life insurance
    - longevity risk: risk of living longer that assets will run out, financial planning is important
      - reduced by purchasing a lifetime annuity
- Measuring and modifying risk exposure
  - Measure risk of specific asset
    - Standard deviation
      - measure of the volatility of <u>asset prices</u> and <u>interest rates</u>
      - **not** fit for measuring of risk for <u>non-normal probability</u>
      - more fit for <u>stand-alone asset</u>, not really fit for portfolios.
    - Beta
      - measure the market risk of **equity securities** and **portfolios**, considering the diversification risk reduction effects
    - Duration
      - measure of <u>price sensitivity</u> of **debt** security to **interests rates** changes
  - Derivation risks($Greeks$)üåü
    - Delta: sensitivity of *derivatives value* to the *price* of underlying asset.($\delta$)
    - Gamma: sensitivity of *Delta* to changes in *price* of underlying asset($\gamma$)
    - Vega: sensitivity of *derivatives values* to the *volatility of the price* of underlying asset($\varOmega$)
    - Rho: sensitivity of *derivatives values* to changes in *risk-free rate*.($\rho$)
  - Measurement of Tail risküåü
    - VaR
      - definition: <u>minimum loss</u> over period will occur with a specific probability
      - do not provide the maximum loss for a period
      - application: bank risk measurement in establishing *minimum capital requirement*
      - method: historical method, Variance-Correlation method, Monte Carlo Simulation
    - CVaR(Conditional Value at Risk)
      - Definition: the <u>expected value at losses</u>,given the losses >> a minimum amount.
      - expected shortfall
  - Subjective and Market-Based Estimates of Risks
    - Stress Testing: examine the effects of <u>extreme changes</u> in a key variable.
    - Scenario Analysis: similar to what-if analysis of expected losses and combined with many inputs changes
    - Subjective Estimate: used for infrequent events, bankruptcy, unexpected changes in tax laws or regulatory environment. 
      - Operational cost: difficult to quantify, using <u>large sample of firms</u> to determine overall probability of significant losses
    - Market-Based Estimates: use **market prices** of insurance, derivatives, or other securities to hedge the risk.
  - Modify Risk Exposures
    - Goal: not to eliminate all risks, but to <u>find optimal</u> mix of risks, through **accept, avoid, transfer, shift** a risk.
      - take on more of some risks, decreasing others, and eliminating some together.
    - Avoid risk: not engaging in the activity which will induce risks
    - Bear the risk: 
      - <u>diversification</u> : a way to beat the risk efficiently.
      - also called **self-insurance**: inaction‰∏çÈááÂèñË°åÂä® or eg: firms will establish a reserve accountÂÇ®Â§áË¥¶Êà∑ to cover loss
    - Risk Transfer:
      - another party takes the risk
      - eg: 
        - **insurance**: The insurance company without <u>high correlated</u> risks or a <u>single very large risk</u> is best. 
          - Solution: this insurance company should shift the risk by <u>buying reinsurance</u> from another company.
        - **Surety Bond**: if the third party fails to perform under terms of agreement with the organization, the insurance company should make a payment.
        - **Fidelity bonds**: insurance company pays for losses from <u>employee theft or misconduct</u>.
    - Risk Shifting:
      - Definition: change the distribution of possible outcomes and is accomplished primarily with <u>derivative contracts</u>.
