## 1. FinTech Description

handle with large datasets, automation to trade and provide investment advice, financial bookkeeping

## 2. Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning

- Big data: 
  - Content: all potentially useful information generated in economy, including traditional sources, non-traditional sources: 
    - social media posts, email, website visits
    - Corporate Exhaust:bank records, retail scanner data
    - Internet of Thing: radio frequency identification chips物联网
  - Characteristic: 
    - volume: increase by orders of magnitude
    - velocity: how quickly data are communicated. 
      - latency潜伏，等待时间: if the data are only communicated periodically or with lag, high latency
    - variety: the varying degrees of `structure` in data may exist.
      - spreadsheet and database; semi-structured forms:photos, web page code; unstructured forms:video
  - Processing data
    - capture: collect data and transform it to usable forms
    - curation: data quality, missing value or bad data handling
    - storage
    - search: examine the stored data to find needed information
    - transfer: move data to a source to where they need
  - Visualization:
    - Structured data: charts and graphs
    - Unstructured data: word clouds, mind map
  - Challenge: 
    - Data quality problem: bad or missing values, outliers, sampling bias.
    - Volume of data should be sufficient
- Artificial Intelligence
  - deal with unstructured and qualitative data, Neutral network, machine learning with train/validation/test data
    - supervised learning
    - unsupervised learning
    - Deep learning
  - Problem:
    - Overfitting: treat noise too serious, machine creates a model that too complex
    - Underfitting: machine fails to identify the actual partterns and relationships
    - Black box

## 3. Fintech Applications to Investment Management

- Text analytics: analysis of unstructured data in text or voice forms. Financially, use in evaluate company regulatory filings.
- NLP: speech recognition, language translation, using to check the large volumes of financial reports
- Risk analysis: risk assessment and stress testing, scenario analysis
- Algorithmic trading: computerized securities trading based on predetermined set of rules, executing large orders with real-time price and volumes, HFT, using intraday securities mispricing.
- Robo-advisor: online platforms providing automated investment advice for some questions about financial position, return objectives, risk tolerance, constraints(time horizon and liquidity)
  - Advantages: low costs to customers 
  - Disadvantages: recommendations are not apparent sometimes, without explanation.

## 4. Financial Applications of Distribution Ledger Technology

- Distributed ledger:
  - Definition: a shared database network, which every participant gains identical copy.
  - have a consensus mechanism to *validate the new entries* to enter
  - use <u>cryptography</u> to authorize only participants use the data.
- Blockchain: 
  - Definition: a distributed ledger that records transactions sequentially in blocks and links together by hash
  - **Miners** as consensus mechanism to solve some cryptography problems, which require lots of computing power and electricity resources.
- Forms:
  - Permissionless networks
    - all network participants can view all transactions
    - no central authority, having no single point of failure
    - ledger is a permanent record, and histories **cannot** be altered(**manipulated**), which <u>removes the need for trust</u> between parties to a transaction
  - permission networks
    - users have different levels of access
    - have government regulators to review the historical records。如果企业配合的话，removing compliance costs and increase transparency.
- Financial Applications
  - Cryptocurrencies
    - Definition: an <u>electronic medium of exchange</u> that allows participants to engage in real time transactions <u>without financial intermediary</u>.
    - typically in permissionless networks
  - Initial coin offering
    - Definition: firms raise capital approach, by <u>selling cryptocurrency</u> for money or other cryptocurrencies.
    - cost less money and time than traditional IPO
    - not come with voting rights管理层结构的稳定性🈶️
  - Post-trade cleaning and settlement
    - distributed ledgers automate many of processes
    - convenient for <u>real-time trade verification and settlement</u>, which in traditional equity investment spends >=1 days, reducing costs and counterparty risk
    - Drawback: when cancelling a trade, <u>inability to alter past transactions</u> on distributed ledger.灵活性不够
  - Smart contracts
    - Definition: electronic contracts that self-execute based on terms agreed to by counterparties.如果交易条件达到了，通过程序自动执行交易。
  - Tokenization
    - Definition: electronic proof of <u>ownership</u> of physical assets, which can be maintained on a distributed ledger.
