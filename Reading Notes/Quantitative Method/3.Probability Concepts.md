## 1. Conditional & Joint Probabilities

- Some concepts:
  - Event: outcome
  - Mutually exclusive events:cannot happen both simultaneously
  - Exhaustive events: include all possible outcomes
- Probability Property:

  - $0≤P(E_i)≤1$
  - $\sum P(E_i)=1$

- Types of Probabilities:

  - Empirical:get by analyzing data(outcome)
  - Prior:get by using formal reasoning or inspection process 推理
  - Subjective: the least formal method with personal judgment 带有主观性
  - Objective: includes empirical or prior probabilities

- Odds: the event will or will not occur
  - format: the odd **for** event occur is $P(occur)/P(not \space occur)$, on the other hand, the odd **against** the event occur take the reciprocal.
  - With the given odd for/against, we can also get the **probability** of occurrence or not occurrence.
- Conditional Probability:

  - **Unconditional Probability**(Marginal Probability): the event probabilities without any past or future occurrence of other events.不受未来或过去任何其他事件的影响。
  - **Conditional Probability**(likelihood): occurrence of one event affects that of another.
    - $P(A|B)$, the occurrence of event A, with the given occurrence of event B

- Multiplication and Addition Rules
  - Addition:
    - **Union**: at least one of two events will occur
      - $P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(AB)$
      - For mutually exclusive events: $P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)$
  - Multiplication:
    - **Joint Probability**: two events will both occur
      - $P(AB)=P(A|B)*P(B)$
      - $P(A|B)=\frac{P(AB)}{P(B)}$, with 1 unconditional probability\*1 conditional probability
      - $P(A∩B)=P(A)*P(B)$, for independent events

## 2. Conditional Expectations & Expected Value

- Dependent & Independent Events

  - Independent event:
    - Definition: the occurrence of one has _no_ effects on the occurrence of the others
    - Function: $P(A|B)=P(A)$ or $P(B|A)=P(B)$
  - Else, they are dependent events.

- Total Probability Rule

  - Function: $P(A)=P(A|B_1)P(B_1)+P(A|B_2)P(B_2)+...+P(A|B_N)P(B_N)$←$P(A)=P(AB_1)(AB_2)...(AB_N)$
    - $P(A)$: unconditional probability
    - $\lbrace S_1,S_2,...,S_N \rbrace$: set of events which are <u>mutually exclusive and exhaustive</u>.
  - Application:
    - Conditional Expected Values can be used in Financial investment.
    - Probability Tree: show the probabilities of various outcomes

- Expected Value, Variance, and STD of Random Variables
  - **Expected Value**: weighted average of possible outcomes of the variable
    - Function: $E(X)=\sum_{i=1}^n P(x_i)x_i=P(x_1)x_1+P(x_2)x_2+...+P(x_n)x_n$
      - $X$: event
      - $x_i$: possible outcomes
  - **Volatility**: Variance & Standard Deviation
    - Function:
      - $Var(X)=\sum_{i=1}^n P[(x_i-E(X))^2]$
        - Probability-weighted sum of the squared deviations from the mean
      - $std(X)=\sqrt[2]{\sum_{i=1}^n P[(x_i-E(X))^2]}$

## 3. Portfolio Variance, Bayes, and Counting Problems

- Portfolio expected return:
  - $R_p=\sum_{i=1}^nw_iE(R_i)$
    - $w_i$=market value of asset i/that of entire portfolio
- Covariance with Assets:

  - How two assets move together.
  - $Cov(R_i,R_j)=E \lbrace[R_i-E(R_i)][R_j-E(R_j)]\rbrace$
  - Covariance Properties:
    - $Cov(R_i,R_i)=Var(R_i)$
    - $Cov(R_i,R_j)=Cov(R_j,R_i)$, the order is not important
    - range: $[-∞,∞]$
    - Cov>0, means one random variable above the mean, the others trend to **above** the mean as well.
    - Cov<0, means one random variable above the mean, the others trend to **below** the mean.
  - Sample Covariance for sample return data:
    - $s_{X,Y}=\frac {\sum_{i=1}^n[(R_{1,i}-\bar{R_1})(R_{2,i}-\bar{R_2})]}{n-1}$
      - $R_{1,i}$:an observation of returns on asset 1
      - $\bar{R_1}$: mean return of asset 1
  - Covariance Matrix:
    - shows the covariances between returns on group of assets(n\*n)
    - elements on <u>diagonal</u> are the **variance** of each asset's return
    - For $n$ assets, we have $n$ variances, and $n(n-1)/2$ unique covariance terms in matrix.

- Portfolio Variance:

  - $Var(R_p)=\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j=1}^NCov(R_i,R_j)$
  - if N=2, $Var(R_p)=w_Aw_BCov(R_A,R_A)+w_Aw_BCov(R_A,R_B)+w_Bw_ACov(R_B,R_A)+w_Bw_BCov(R_B,R_B)$ or
    - $\sigma^2_p=w^2_A\sigma^2_A+w^2_B\sigma^2_B+2w_Aw_BCov_{AB}$
  - if N=3, $\sigma^2_p=w^2_A\sigma^2_A+w^2_B\sigma^2_B+w^2_C\sigma^2_C+2w_Aw_BCov_{AB}+2w_Aw_CCov_{AC}+2w_Bw_CCov_{BC}$
  - the units of Variance and Covariance is %^2
  - The lower covariance between assets, the lower portfolio variance

- Correlation:
  - use _correlation matrix_ to solve
  - Function: $\rho_{AB}=\frac{Cov_{AB}}{\rho_A\rho_B}$
  - the diagonal items=1
- Bayes:

  - Logic:

  ```
  Updated Probability=(probability of new information for a given event/unconditional probability of new information) * prior probability of event
  ```

  - Function:
    - $P(B|A)*P(A)=P(B∩A)$
    - $P(A|B)*P(B)=P(A∩B)$
    - since, $P(AB)=P(BA)$, we get:
      - $P(B|A)*P(A)=P(A|B)*P(B)$
      - $\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}=\frac{P(B∩A)}{P(B)}$

- Counting
  - Labeling: there are n items that each one receives <u>one of K</u> different labels.
    - Total numbers of ways that the label can be $\frac{n!}{(n_1!)(n_2!)*...*(n_k!)}$
      - $n_1$: the number of items receiving label 1
      - $\sum_{i=1}^kn_i=n$
      - $k$: number of labels
    - Financial calculator: to compute n!, `[n][2nd][x!]`
  - Combination:
    - Intuition: the number of ways selecting $r$ items from a set of $n$ items when the order is not important.
    - when $k=2$, $r=n_1$, and $n_2=n-r$, the special case of original counting rule
    - Function: $C_k^n=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}$
    - Financial Calculator: `[n][2nd][nCr][r][=]`
  - Permutation:
    - Intuition: the number of ways selecting $r$ items <u>in special order</u> from $n$ items
    - Function: $P_k^n=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
    - Relationship: $P_k^n=r!*C_k^n$
    - Financial Calculator: `[n][2nd][nPr][r][=]`
