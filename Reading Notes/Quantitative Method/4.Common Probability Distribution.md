## 1. Uniform and Binomial Distribution

- Probability Distribution

  - discrete random variable→discrete probability distribution
  - probability function $P(x)=P(X=x)$
  - continuous random variable→continuous probability distribution
  - Difference between discrete dis(A) and continuous dis(B):
    1.  $P(x)=0$:
        - A the event not occur
        - B the event x can occur, since $x$ is a `single point` in a range
    2.  $P(x)$:
        - A: the probability that random variable $X=x$
        - B: we only consider $P(x_1≤X≤x_2)$, which $=P(x_1<X<x_2)$, since $P(x_1)=P(x_2)=0$

- Cumulative Distribution Function(cdf)

  - $F(x)=P(X≤x)$
  - intuition: takes on a value equal to or less than a specific value

- Discrete Uniform Random Distribution
  - probabilities for all possible outcomes for a discrete r.v. are **equal**.
  - Cumulative distribution function: $F(x_n)=np(x)$.
    - the probability of a range of outcomes is $P(x)k$,where $k$ is the number of possible outcomes in this range.
- Properties of Continuous Uniform Distribution

  - $a≤x_1≤x_2≤b$, where $a$ and $b$ are boundaries
  - $P(X<a \space or \space X>b)$=0, when $X$ is outside the value
  - $P(x_1≤X≤x_2)=\frac{x_2-x_1}{b-a}$, the probability that outcomes locating in the range of $[x_1,x_2]$
  - Graphically, cdf of continuous uniform dist is `linear`, sum up to 1.

- Bernoulli Random Variable, Binomial random variable, Binomial Distribution
  - Binomial random variable: define the number of "success" in a given number of experiments($n$), which the outcomes can be "success" or "failure".
    - $p$: the possibility of success
  - Bernoulli Random Variable: when <u>$n=1$</u>, the special case of binominal random variable.
  - Binominal Distribution:
    - Define the probability of $x$ success in $n$ trials.
    - Function: $p(x)=\frac{n!}{(n-x)!x!}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}=\begin{pmatrix}n\\x\\ \end{pmatrix}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$
      - $\begin{pmatrix}n\\x\\ \end{pmatrix}$:number of ways to choose $x$ from $n$.
    - Expected Value and Variance:
      - the expected number of success with $n$ trials:$E(X)=np$
      - $Var(X)=np(1-p)$

## 2. Normal Distribution

- Properties:
  - $X~N(\mu,\sigma^2)$
  - $Skewness=0$, mean=median=mode, symmetric about mean
  - $Kurtosis=3$
  - <u>Linear combination of normally distributed variables</u> is also normally distributed.
    - Eg: if the <u>return of each stock</u> in a portfolio is normally distributed, the return on the <u>portfolio</u> will also follow normal distribution.
- Multivariate VS Univariate Distribution

  - Univariate Distribution:
    - the distribution of <u>single</u> random variable
  - Multivariate Distribution:
    - associated with multiple random variables regardless discrete or continuous variables
    - Between <u>2 discrete variables</u> can be described using **joint probability tables**
  - The Role of _Correlation_ in Multivariate Normal Distribution
    - one important feature distinguish multivariate dist from univariate dist
    - the strength of _linear relationship_ between a pair of r.v.
    - parameterized with $n$ assets:
      - $n$ means: $(\mu_1,\mu_2,...,\mu_n)$
      - $n$ variance: $(\sigma_1^2,\sigma_2^2,...,\sigma_n^2)$
      - pair-wised correlation: $0.5n(n-1)$
    - the lower the better, because of lower portfolio variance.

- Confidence Interval(CI)

  - Definition: <u>a range of values</u> around the <u>expected outcome</u> within which we expected the actual outcome to be <u>specified percentage</u> of a time.
  - For _normal distribution_, CI width depends on **expected value** and **std**. $E(X)±k\sigma$
    - $E(X)±\sigma$:68%
    - $E(X)±2\sigma$:95%
  - Sometimes we need to use **sample mean and sample std** to estimate population situation:
    - 90% CI for X: $[\bar{x}-1.65*s,\bar{x}+1.65*s]$
    - 95% CI for X: $[\bar{x}-1.96*s,\bar{x}+1.96*s]$
    - 99% CI for X: $[\bar{x}-2.58*s,\bar{x}+2.58*s]$

- Standard Normal Distribution

  - $z=\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma} \sim N(0,1)$
  - Standardization: observed value-> z-score.
  - Z-score means **how many standard deviation above/below the mean**
  - CDF of standard normal distribution
    - $F(Z)=P(Z<z)$
    - the usage of `z-table`, only contains positive z-values
    - Transform of negative z-values: $F(-Z)=1-F(Z)$

- Shortfall Risk, Safety-first Ratio, Optimal Portfolio Identification
  - Shortfall Risk: $P(R_p<R_L)$
  - Roy's safety-first criterion, for optimal portfolio
    - Function: $minP(R_p<R_L)$
      - $R_L$: threshold acceptable level return
  - If the portfolio is **normally distributed**, Roy's safety-first criterion
    - Function: $max\space SFRatio$, where $SFRatio=\frac{E(R_p)-R_L}{\sigma_p}$
      - $SFRatio$: the number of std _below_ the mean, when calculate the probability, it is the `left-tail` of standard normal distribution in graph. $F(-SFRatio_{max})$
      - SFRatio`↑`, portfolio return< threshold return`↓`

## 3. Log-normal, T, Chi-Square, F-distribution

- Log-normal Distribution

  - Function: $e^x$, where $x$ is normally distributed.
  - skewed to the right
  - range:$[0,\infty]$, which is used for `asset pricing`
    - price relative: $S1/S0=1+HPR$
      - $S_1$:end-of-period price
      - $S_2$:beginning price
      - $HPR$: holding period return
      - treated as up or down-move(multiplier) terms
  - Calculating **Continuously** Compounded Returns
    - When the compounding periods become shorter and shorter, we use continuously compounding technique
    - Function: $EAR=e^{R_{CC}}-1$, where $R_{CC}$ is stated annual rate.
    - Financial Calculator: `[value of Rcc][ln][CPT]`
    - $Rcc=ln(1+HPR)=ln(\frac{S_1}{S_0})$
    - Additive for multiple periods: $HPR_T=e^{Rcc*T}-1$

- Student T-Distribution

  - bell shape,centered about 0
  - used for <u>small samples(n<30)</u> with approximately normal distribution or <u>large sample</u>(CLT) from populations with unknown variance.
  - Degree of freedom(df): n-1, based on the test of sample means
  - Fatter tails than normal distribution, more area under tails
  - CI for t-dist more `wider` than that of normal dist
  - When n(or df) larger, t-dist more close to standard normal distribution, t-dist become more thinner tails and spiked.
  - more difficult to reject H0 than using normal dist
  - $\alpha_{twoTails}=2*\alpha_{oneTail}$
  - critical value increase with df decrease.

- Chi-Square($\chi^2$)

  - df: $k=n-1$
  - Asymmetric
  - when df increases, its distribution symmetric increase, approaching normal distribution gradually
  - used for tests whether the values of `variance` are `equal` of normally distributed population
  - range:[-$\infty$,0]

- F-Distribution

  - including two approximately scaled independent chi-square variables, with df $m$ and $n$
  - $F=\frac{\chi^2/m}{\chi^2/n}$
  - Asymmetric
  - when m and n get larger, the F-distribution become more symmetric and more similar to normal dist.
  - cannot take on negative values
  - usage of F-distribution table

- Monte Carlo Simulation
  - repeated generation of >=1 risk factors with specified parameters(mean,variance,skewness...) to generate a distribution of security values, calculate the mean value as the estimation results.
